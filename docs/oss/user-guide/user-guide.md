## Onboard teams and applications

Onboarding teams and applications is all done the gitops way. We provide Backstage scaffolder templates to create corresponding Pull-Requests and git repositories easily.

First you need to onboard your team according to our [Team-Onboarding-Documentation](https://github.com/suxess-it/kubriX/blob/main/backstage-resources/docs/onboarding/onboarding-teams.md ).
Then continue with [onbarding new applications](https://github.com/suxess-it/kubriX/blob/main/backstage-resources/docs/onboarding/onboarding-apps.md).
