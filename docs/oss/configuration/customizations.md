# How to customize kubriX for your needs

## Customizing the kubriX stack

As described in [Preparing values files](../installation/production.md#preparing-values-files)
you can add new platform services in the `sx-bootstrap-app` and extend kubriX with your special bricks.

Also, you can customize existing platform services by

* changing values in your own helm values files
* adding your own template files in the helm charts `templates` directory
