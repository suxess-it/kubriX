# Test for the platform

This document should describe which automatic tests are implemented, how changes walk through our platform-pipeline and how we want to ensure quality in our platform stack.
Still tbd and should reflect things of https://github.com/suxess-it/kubriX/issues/232 and https://github.com/suxess-it/kubriX/issues/231

Also, how you can test and develop the platform in a new feature branch.
