# Platform building blocks and cluster flavors

This document explains how to add new platform building blocks (helm charts) and how to compose them to a cluster flavor (target-chart).
This document is primarly for platform engineers. It is still a draft and should include implementations of https://github.com/suxess-it/kubriX/issues/157 and how the 

- charts in https://github.com/suxess-it/kubriX/tree/main/platform-apps/charts
- this target-chart (naming??) https://github.com/suxess-it/kubriX/tree/main/platform-apps/target-chart
- the bootstrap-app like https://github.com/suxess-it/kubriX/blob/main/bootstrap-app-kind.yaml
- and https://github.com/suxess-it/kubriX/blob/main/install-platform.sh

fit together.
