      "description": "A helper to merge structs and maps in Golang. Useful for configuration default values, avoiding messy if-statements.\n\nMergo merges same-type structs and maps by setting default values in zero-value fields. Mergo won't merge unexported (private) fields. It will do recursively any exported one. It also won't merge structs inside maps (because they are not addressable using Go reflection).\n\nIt is ready for production use. It is used in several projects by Docker, Google, The Linux Foundation, VMWare, Shopify, etc.\n\n1.0.0\n\nIn 1.0.0 Mergo moves to a vanity URL `dario.cat/mergo`.\n\n0.3.9\n\nPlease keep in mind that a problematic PR broke 0.3.9. We reverted it in 0.3.10. We consider 0.3.10 as stable but not bug-free. . Also, this version adds suppot for go modules.\n\nKeep in mind that in 0.3.2, Mergo changed Merge() and Map() signatures to support transformers. We added an optional/variadic argument so that it won't break the existing code.\n\nIf you were using Mergo before April 6th, 2015, please check your project works as intended after updating your local copy with go get -u dario.cat/mergo. I apologize for any issue caused by its previous behavior and any future bug that Mergo could cause in existing projects after the change (release 0.2.0).\n\nDo your usual installation procedure:\n\nYou can only merge same-type structs with exported fields initialized as zero value of their type and same-types maps. Mergo won't merge unexported (private) fields but will do recursively any exported one. It won't merge empty structs value as they are zero values too. Also, maps will be merged recursively except for structs inside maps (because they are not addressable using Go reflection).\n\nAlso, you can merge overwriting values using the transformer WithOverride.\n\nAdditionally, you can map a map[string]interface{} to a struct (and otherwise, from struct to map), following the same restrictions as in Merge(). Keys are capitalized to find each corresponding exported field.\n\nWarning: if you map a struct to map, it won't do it recursively. Don't expect Mergo to map struct members of your struct as map[string]interface{}. They will be just assigned as values.\n\nHere is a nice example:\n\nTransformers allow to merge specific types differently than in the default behavior. In other words, now you can customize how some types are merged. For example, time.Time is a struct; it doesn't have zero value but IsZero can return true because it has fields with zero value. How can we merge a non-zero time.Time?\n\nIf I can help you, you have an idea or you are using Mergo in your projects, don't hesitate to drop me a line (or a pull request): https://twitter.com/im_dario\n\nWritten by Dario Castañé: https://da.rio.hn\n\nBSD 3-Clause license, as Go language.",

It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks.\nFrom a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build parse trees and also generates a listener interface\n(or visitor) that makes it easy to respond to the recognition of phrases of interest.\n\nAt version 4.11.x and prior, the Go runtime was not properly versioned for go modules. After this point, the runtime\nsource code to be imported was held in the `runtime/Go/antlr/v4` directory, and the go.mod file was updated to reflect the version of\nANTLR4 that it is compatible with (I.E. uses the /v4 path).\n\nHowever, this was found to be problematic, as it meant that with the runtime embedded so far underneath the root\nof the repo, the `go get` and related commands could not properly resolve the location of the go runtime source code.\nThis meant that the reference to the runtime in your `go.mod` file would refer to the correct source code, but would not\nlist the release tag such as @4.13.1 - this was confusing, to say the least.\n\nAs of 4.13.0, the runtime is now available as a go module in its own repo, and can be imported as `github.com/antlr4-go/antlr`\n(the go get command should also be used with this path). See the main documentation for the ANTLR4 project for more information,\nwhich is available at ANTLR docs. The documentation for using the Go runtime is available at Go runtime docs.\n\nThis means that if you are using the source code without modules, you should also use the source code in the new repo.\nThough we highly recommend that you use go modules, as they are now idiomatic for Go.\n\nI am aware that this change will prove Hyrum's Law, but am prepared to live with it for the common good.\n\nGo runtime author: Jim Idle jimi@idle.ws\n\nANTLR supports the generation of code in a number of target languages, and the generated code is supported by a\nruntime library, written specifically to support the generated code in the target language. This library is the\nruntime for the Go target.\n\nTo generate code for the go target, it is generally recommended to place the source grammar files in a package of\ntheir own, and use the `.sh` script method of generating code, using the go generate directive. In that same directory\nit is usual, though not required, to place the antlr tool that should be used to generate the code. That does mean\nthat the antlr tool JAR file will be checked in to your source code control though, so you are, of course, free to use any other\nway of specifying the version of the ANTLR tool to use, such as aliasing in `.zshrc` or equivalent, or a profile in\nyour IDE, or configuration in your CI system. Checking in the jar does mean that it is easy to reproduce the build as\nit was at any point in its history.\n\nHere is a general/recommended template for an ANTLR based recognizer in Go:\n\nMake sure that the package statement in your grammar file(s) reflects the go package the generated code will exist in.\n\nThe generate.go file then looks like this:\n\nAnd the generate.sh file will look similar to this:\n\ndepending on whether you want visitors or listeners or any other ANTLR options. Not that another option here\nis to generate the code into a\n\nFrom the command line at the root of your source package (location of go.mo)d) you can then simply issue the command:\n\nWhich will generate the code for the parser, and place it in the parsing package. You can then use the generated code\nby importing the parsing package.\n\nThere are no hard and fast rules on this. It is just a recommendation. You can generate the code in any way and to anywhere you like.\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2023 The ANTLR Project.

      "description": "Package platforms provides a toolkit for normalizing, matching and\nspecifying container platforms.\n\nCentered around OCI platform specifications, we define a string-based\nspecifier syntax that can be used for user input. With a specifier, users\nonly need to specify the parts of the platform that are relevant to their\ncontext, providing an operating system or architecture or both.\n\nHow do I use this package?\n\nThe vast majority of use cases should simply use the match function with\nuser input. The first step is to parse a specifier into a matcher:\n\nOnce you have a matcher, use it to match against the platform declared by a\ncomponent, typically from an image or runtime. Since extracting an images\nplatform is a little more involved, we'll use an example against the\nplatform default:\n\nThis can be composed in loops for resolving runtimes or used as a filter for\nfetch and select images.\n\nMore details of the specifier syntax and platform spec follow.\n\nComponents that have strict platform requirements should use the OCI\nplatform specification to declare their support. Typically, this will be\nimages and runtimes that should make these declaring which platform they\nsupport specifically. This looks roughly as follows:\n\nMost images and runtimes should at least set Architecture and OS, according\nto their GOARCH and GOOS values, respectively (follow the OCI image\nspecification when in doubt). ARM should set variant under certain\ndiscussions, which are outlined below.\n\nWhile the OCI platform specifications provide a tool for components to\nspecify structured information, user input typically doesn't need the full\ncontext and much can be inferred. To solve this problem, we introduced\n\"specifiers\". A specifier has the format\n`<os>|<arch>|<os>/<arch>[/<variant>]`.  The user can provide either the\noperating system or the architecture or both.\n\nAn example of a common specifier is `linux/amd64`. If the host has a default\nof runtime that matches this, the user can simply provide the component that\nmatters. For example, if a image provides amd64 and arm64 support, the\noperating system, `linux` can be inferred, so they only have to provide\n`arm64` or `amd64`. Similar behavior is implemented for operating systems,\nwhere the architecture may be known but a runtime may support images from\ndifferent operating systems.\n\nBecause not all users are familiar with the way the Go runtime represents\nplatforms, several normalizations have been provided to make this package\neasier to user.\n\nThe following are performed for architectures:\n\nWe also normalize the operating system `macos` to `darwin`.\n\nTo qualify ARM architecture, the Variant field is used to qualify the arm\nversion. The most common arm version, v7, is represented without the variant\nunless it is explicitly provided. This is treated as equivalent to armhf. A\nprevious architecture, armel, will be normalized to arm/v6.\n\nSimilarly, the most common arm64 version v8, and most common amd64 version v1\nare represented without the variant.\n\nWhile these normalizations are provided, their support on arm platforms has\nnot yet been fully implemented and tested.",

      "description": "Package securejoin implements a set of helpers to make it easier to write Go\ncode that is safe against symlink-related escape attacks. The primary idea\nis to let you resolve a path within a rootfs directory as if the rootfs was\na chroot.\n\nsecurejoin has two APIs, a \"legacy\" API and a \"modern\" API.\n\nThe legacy API is SecureJoin and SecureJoinVFS. These methods are\n**not** safe against race conditions where an attacker changes the\nfilesystem after (or during) the SecureJoin operation.\n\nThe new API is available in the pathrs-lite subpackage, and provide\nprotections against racing attackers as well as several other key\nprotections against attacks often seen by container runtimes. As the name\nsuggests, pathrs-lite is a stripped down (pure Go) reimplementation of\nlibpathrs. The main APIs provided are OpenInRoot, MkdirAll, and\nprocfs.Handle -- other APIs are not planned to be ported. The long-term\ngoal is for users to migrate to libpathrs which is more fully-featured.\n\nsecurejoin has been used by several container runtimes (Docker, runc,\nKubernetes, etc) for quite a few years as a de-facto standard for operating\non container filesystem paths \"safely\". However, most users still use the\nlegacy API which is unsafe against various attacks (there is a fairly long\nhistory of CVEs in dependent as a result). Users should switch to the modern\nAPI as soon as possible (or even better, switch to libpathrs).\n\nThis project was initially intended to be included in the Go standard\nlibrary, but it was rejected (see https://go.dev/issue/20126). Much later,\nos.Root was added to the Go stdlib that shares some of the goals of\nfilepath-securejoin. However, its design is intended to work like\nopenat2(RESOLVE_BENEATH) which does not fit the usecase of container\nruntimes and most system tools.",

      "description": "Package restful , a lean package for creating REST-style WebServices without magic.\n\n### WebServices and Routes\n\nA WebService has a collection of Route objects that dispatch incoming Http Requests to a function calls.\nTypically, a WebService has a root path (e.g. /users) and defines common MIME types for its routes.\nWebServices must be added to a container (see below) in order to handler Http requests from a server.\n\nA Route is defined by a HTTP method, an URL path and (optionally) the MIME types it consumes (Content-Type) and produces (Accept).\nThis package has the logic to find the best matching Route and if found, call its Function.\n\nThe (*Request, *Response) arguments provide functions for reading information from the request and writing information back to the response.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/user-resource/restful-user-resource.go with a full implementation.\n\n### Regular expression matching Routes\n\nA Route parameter can be specified using the format \"uri/{var[:regexp]}\" or the special version \"uri/{var:*}\" for matching the tail of the path.\nFor example, /persons/{name:[A-Z][A-Z]} can be used to restrict values for the parameter \"name\" to only contain capital alphabetic characters.\nRegular expressions must use the standard Go syntax as described in the regexp package. (https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax)\nThis feature requires the use of a CurlyRouter.\n\n### Containers\n\nA Container holds a collection of WebServices, Filters and a http.ServeMux for multiplexing http requests.\nUsing the statements \"restful.Add(...) and restful.Filter(...)\" will register WebServices and Filters to the Default Container.\nThe Default container of go-restful uses the http.DefaultServeMux.\nYou can create your own Container and create a new http.Server for that particular container.\n\n### Filters\n\nA filter dynamically intercepts requests and responses to transform or use the information contained in the requests or responses.\nYou can use filters to perform generic logging, measurement, authentication, redirect, set response headers etc.\nIn the restful package there are three hooks into the request,response flow where filters can be added.\nEach filter must define a FilterFunction:\n\nUse the following statement to pass the request,response pair to the next filter or RouteFunction\n\n### Container Filters\n\nThese are processed before any registered WebService.\n\n### WebService Filters\n\nThese are processed before any Route of a WebService.\n\n### Route Filters\n\nThese are processed before calling the function associated with the Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/filters/restful-filters.go with full implementations.\n\n### Response Encoding\n\nTwo encodings are supported: gzip and deflate. To enable this for all responses:\n\nIf a Http request includes the Accept-Encoding header then the response content will be compressed using the specified encoding.\nAlternatively, you can create a Filter that performs the encoding and install it per WebService or Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/encoding/restful-encoding-filter.go\n\n### OPTIONS support\n\nBy installing a pre-defined container filter, your Webservice(s) can respond to the OPTIONS Http request.\n\n### CORS\n\nBy installing the filter of a CrossOriginResourceSharing (CORS), your WebService(s) can handle CORS requests.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nUnexpected things happen. If a request cannot be processed because of a failure, your service needs to tell via the response what happened and why.\nFor this reason HTTP status codes exist and it is important to use the correct code in every exceptional situation.\n\nIf path or query parameters are not valid (content or type) then use http.StatusBadRequest.\n\nDespite a valid URI, the resource requested may not be available\n\nIf the application logic could not process the request (or write the response) then use http.StatusInternalServerError.\n\nThe request has a valid URL but the method (GET,PUT,POST,...) is not allowed.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Accept Header set for this operation.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Content-Type Header set for this operation.\n\n### ServiceError\n\nIn addition to setting the correct (error) Http status code, you can choose to write a ServiceError message on the response.\n\n### Performance options\n\nThis package has several options that affect the performance of your service. It is important to understand them and how you can change it.\n\nDoNotRecover controls whether panics will be caught to return HTTP 500.\nIf set to false, the container will recover from panics.\nDefault value is true\n\nIf content encoding is enabled then the default strategy for getting new gzip/zlib writers and readers is to use a sync.Pool.\nBecause writers are expensive structures, performance is even more improved when using a preloaded cache. You can also inject your own implementation.\n\n### Trouble shooting\n\nThis package has the means to produce detail logging of the complete Http request matching process and filter invocation.\nEnabling this feature requires you to set an implementation of restful.StdLogger (e.g. log.Logger) instance such as:\n\n### Logging\n\nThe restful.SetLogger() method allows you to override the logger used by the package. By default restful\nuses the standard library `log` package and logs to stdout. Different logging packages are supported as\nlong as they conform to `StdLogger` interface defined in the `log` sub-package, writing an adapter for your\npreferred package is simple.\n\n### Resources\n\n(c) 2012-2025, http://ernestmicklei.com.

Below are some\nexamples to create custom color objects and use the print functions of each\nseparate color object.\n\nYou can create PrintXxx functions to simplify even more:\n\nYou can also FprintXxx functions to pass your own io.Writer:\n\nOr create SprintXxx functions to mix strings with other non-colorized strings:\n\nWindows support is enabled by default. All Print functions work as intended.\nHowever, only for color.SprintXXX functions, user should use fmt.FprintXXX and\nset the output to color.Output:\n\nUsing with existing code is possible. Just use the Set() method to set the\nstandard output to the given parameters. That way a rewrite of an existing\ncode is not required.\n\nThere might be a case where you want to disable color output (for example to\npipe the standard output of your app to somewhere else). `Color` has support to\ndisable colors both globally and for single color definition. For example\nsuppose you have a CLI app and a `--no-color` bool flag.

      "description": "Package cbor is a modern CBOR codec (RFC 8949 & RFC 8742) with CBOR tags,\nGo struct tag options (toarray/keyasint/omitempty/omitzero), Core Deterministic Encoding,\nCTAP2, Canonical CBOR, float64->32->16, and duplicate map key detection.\n\nEncoding options allow \"preferred serialization\" by encoding integers and floats\nto their smallest forms (e.g. float16) when values fit.\n\nStruct tag options \"keyasint\", \"toarray\", \"omitempty\", and \"omitzero\" reduce encoding size\nand reduce programming effort.\n\nFor example, \"toarray\" tag makes struct fields encode to CBOR array elements.  And\n\"keyasint\" makes a field encode to an element of CBOR map with specified int key.\n\nLatest docs can be viewed at https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor#cbor-library-in-go\n\nThe Quick Start guide is at https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor#quick-start\n\nFunction signatures identical to encoding/json include:\n\nStandard interfaces include:\n\nDiagnostic functions translate CBOR data item into Diagnostic Notation:\n\nFunctions that simplify using CBOR Sequences (RFC 8742) include:\n\nCustom encoding and decoding is possible by implementing standard interfaces for\nuser-defined Go types.\n\nCodec functions are available at package-level (using defaults options) or by\ncreating modes from options at runtime.\n\n\"Mode\" in this API means definite way of encoding (EncMode) or decoding (DecMode).\n\nEncMode and DecMode interfaces are created from EncOptions or DecOptions structs.\n\nModes use immutable options to avoid side-effects and simplify concurrency. Behavior of\nmodes won't accidentally change at runtime after they're created.\n\nModes are intended to be reused and are safe for concurrent use.\n\nEncMode and DecMode Interfaces\n\nUsing Default Encoding Mode\n\nUsing Default Decoding Mode\n\nUsing Default Mode of UnmarshalFirst to Decode CBOR Sequences\n\nUsing Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN) to represent CBOR data\n\nCreating and Using Encoding Modes\n\nPredefined Encoding Options: https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor#predefined-encoding-options\n\nEncoding Options: https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor#encoding-options\n\nDecoding Options: https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor#decoding-options\n\nStruct tags like `cbor:\"name,omitempty\"` and `json:\"name,omitempty\"` work as expected.\nIf both struct tags are specified then `cbor` is used.\n\nStruct tag options like \"keyasint\", \"toarray\", \"omitempty\", and \"omitzero\" make it easy to use\nvery compact formats like COSE and CWT (CBOR Web Tokens) with structs.\n\nThe \"omitzero\" option omits zero values from encoding, matching\n[stdlib encoding/json behavior](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json#Marshal).\nWhen specified in the `cbor` tag, the option is always honored.\nWhen specified in the `json` tag, the option is honored when building with Go 1.24+.\n\nFor example, \"toarray\" makes struct fields encode to array elements.  And \"keyasint\"\nmakes struct fields encode to elements of CBOR map with int keys.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/fxamacker/images/master/cbor/v2.0.0/cbor_easy_api.png\n\nStruct tag options are listed at https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor#struct-tags-1\n\nOver 375 tests are included in this package.

      "description": "Package logr defines a general-purpose logging API and abstract interfaces\nto back that API.  Packages in the Go ecosystem can depend on this package,\nwhile callers can implement logging with whatever backend is appropriate.\n\nLogging is done using a Logger instance.  Logger is a concrete type with\nmethods, which defers the actual logging to a LogSink interface.  The main\nmethods of Logger are Info() and Error().  Arguments to Info() and Error()\nare key/value pairs rather than printf-style formatted strings, emphasizing\n\"structured logging\".\n\nWith Go's standard log package, we might write:\n\nWith logr's structured logging, we'd write:\n\nErrors are much the same.  Instead of:\n\nWe'd write:\n\nInfo() and Error() are very similar, but they are separate methods so that\nLogSink implementations can choose to do things like attach additional\ninformation (such as stack traces) on calls to Error(). Error() messages are\nalways logged, regardless of the current verbosity.  If there is no error\ninstance available, passing nil is valid.\n\nOften we want to log information only when the application in \"verbose\nmode\".  To write log lines that are more verbose, Logger has a V() method.\nThe higher the V-level of a log line, the less critical it is considered.\nLog-lines with V-levels that are not enabled (as per the LogSink) will not\nbe written.  Level V(0) is the default, and logger.V(0).Info() has the same\nmeaning as logger.Info().  Negative V-levels have the same meaning as V(0).\nError messages do not have a verbosity level and are always logged.\n\nWhere we might have written:\n\nWe can write:\n\nLogger instances can have name strings so that all messages logged through\nthat instance have additional context.  For example, you might want to add\na subsystem name:\n\nThe WithName() method returns a new Logger, which can be passed to\nconstructors or other functions for further use.  Repeated use of WithName()\nwill accumulate name \"segments\".  These name segments will be joined in some\nway by the LogSink implementation.  It is strongly recommended that name\nsegments contain simple identifiers (letters, digits, and hyphen), and do\nnot contain characters that could muddle the log output or confuse the\njoining operation (e.g. whitespace, commas, periods, slashes, brackets,\nquotes, etc).\n\nLogger instances can store any number of key/value pairs, which will be\nlogged alongside all messages logged through that instance.  For example,\nyou might want to create a Logger instance per managed object:\n\nWith the standard log package, we might write:\n\nWith logr we'd write:\n\nLogger has very few hard rules, with the goal that LogSink implementations\nmight have a lot of freedom to differentiate.  There are, however, some\nthings to consider.\n\nThe log message consists of a constant message attached to the log line.\nThis should generally be a simple description of what's occurring, and should\nnever be a format string.  Variable information can then be attached using\nnamed values.\n\nKeys are arbitrary strings, but should generally be constant values.  Values\nmay be any Go value, but how the value is formatted is determined by the\nLogSink implementation.\n\nLogger instances are meant to be passed around by value. Code that receives\nsuch a value can call its methods without having to check whether the\ninstance is ready for use.\n\nThe zero logger (= Logger{}) is identical to Discard() and discards all log\nentries. Code that receives a Logger by value can simply call it, the methods\nwill never crash. For cases where passing a logger is optional, a pointer to Logger\nshould be used.\n\nKeys are not strictly required to conform to any specification or regex, but\nit is recommended that they:\n\nThese guidelines help ensure that log data is processed properly regardless\nof the log implementation.  For example, log implementations will try to\noutput JSON data or will store data for later database (e.g. SQL) queries.\n\nWhile users are generally free to use key names of their choice, it's\ngenerally best to avoid using the following keys, as they're frequently used\nby implementations:\n\nImplementations are encouraged to make use of these keys to represent the\nabove concepts, when necessary (for example, in a pure-JSON output form, it\nwould be necessary to represent at least message and timestamp as ordinary\nnamed values).\n\nImplementations may choose to give callers access to the underlying\nlogging implementation.  The recommended pattern for this is:\n\nLogger grants access to the sink to enable type assertions like this:\n\nCustom `With*` functions can be implemented by copying the complete\nLogger struct and replacing the sink in the copy:\n\nDon't use New to construct a new Logger with a LogSink retrieved from an\nexisting Logger. Source code attribution might not work correctly and\nunexported fields in Logger get lost.\n\nBeware that the same LogSink instance may be shared by different logger\ninstances. Calling functions that modify the LogSink will affect all of\nthose.",

Any given level\nin logr is represents by its inverse in zap (`zapLevel = -1*logrLevel`).\nFor example V(2) is equivalent to log level -2 in Zap, while V(1) is\nequivalent to Zap's DebugLevel.",

      "description": "Package btree implements in-memory B-Trees of arbitrary degree.\n\nbtree implements an in-memory B-Tree for use as an ordered data structure.\nIt is not meant for persistent storage solutions.\n\nIt has a flatter structure than an equivalent red-black or other binary tree,\nwhich in some cases yields better memory usage and/or performance.\nSee some discussion on the matter here:\n\nNote, though, that this project is in no way related to the C++ B-Tree\nimplementation written about there.\n\nWithin this tree, each node contains a slice of items and a (possibly nil)\nslice of children.  For basic numeric values or raw structs, this can cause\nefficiency differences when compared to equivalent C++ template code that\nstores values in arrays within the node:\n\nThese issues don't tend to matter, though, when working with strings or other\nheap-allocated structures, since C++-equivalent structures also must store\npointers and also distribute their values across the heap.\n\nThis implementation is designed to be a drop-in replacement to gollrb.LLRB\ntrees, (http://github.com/petar/gollrb), an excellent and probably the most\nwidely used ordered tree implementation in the Go ecosystem currently.\nIts functions, therefore, exactly mirror those of\nllrb.LLRB where possible.  Unlike gollrb, though, we currently don't\nsupport storing multiple equivalent values.\n\nThere are two implementations; those suffixed with 'G' are generics, usable\nfor any type, and require a passed-in \"less\" function to define their ordering.\nThose without this prefix are specific to the 'Item' interface, and use\nits 'Less' function for ordering.",

      "description": "Package websocket implements the WebSocket protocol defined in RFC 6455.\n\nThe Conn type represents a WebSocket connection. A server application calls\nthe Upgrader.Upgrade method from an HTTP request handler to get a *Conn:\n\nCall the connection's WriteMessage and ReadMessage methods to send and\nreceive messages as a slice of bytes. This snippet of code shows how to echo\nmessages using these methods:\n\nIn above snippet of code, p is a []byte and messageType is an int with value\nwebsocket.BinaryMessage or websocket.TextMessage.\n\nAn application can also send and receive messages using the io.WriteCloser\nand io.Reader interfaces. To send a message, call the connection NextWriter\nmethod to get an io.WriteCloser, write the message to the writer and close\nthe writer when done. To receive a message, call the connection NextReader\nmethod to get an io.Reader and read until io.EOF is returned. This snippet\nshows how to echo messages using the NextWriter and NextReader methods:\n\nThe WebSocket protocol distinguishes between text and binary data messages.\nText messages are interpreted as UTF-8 encoded text. The interpretation of\nbinary messages is left to the application.\n\nThis package uses the TextMessage and BinaryMessage integer constants to\nidentify the two data message types. The ReadMessage and NextReader methods\nreturn the type of the received message. The messageType argument to the\nWriteMessage and NextWriter methods specifies the type of a sent message.\n\nIt is the application's responsibility to ensure that text messages are\nvalid UTF-8 encoded text.\n\nThe WebSocket protocol defines three types of control messages: close, ping\nand pong. Call the connection WriteControl, WriteMessage or NextWriter\nmethods to send a control message to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received close messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetCloseHandler method and by returning a *CloseError from the\nNextReader, ReadMessage or the message Read method. The default close\nhandler sends a close message to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received ping messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetPingHandler method. The default ping handler sends a pong\nmessage to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received pong messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetPongHandler method. The default pong handler does nothing.\nIf an application sends ping messages, then the application should set a\npong handler to receive the corresponding pong.\n\nThe control message handler functions are called from the NextReader,\nReadMessage and message reader Read methods. The default close and ping\nhandlers can block these methods for a short time when the handler writes to\nthe connection.\n\nThe application must read the connection to process close, ping and pong\nmessages sent from the peer. If the application is not otherwise interested\nin messages from the peer, then the application should start a goroutine to\nread and discard messages from the peer. A simple example is:\n\nConnections support one concurrent reader and one concurrent writer.\n\nApplications are responsible for ensuring that no more than one goroutine\ncalls the write methods (NextWriter, SetWriteDeadline, WriteMessage,\nWriteJSON, EnableWriteCompression, SetCompressionLevel) concurrently and\nthat no more than one goroutine calls the read methods (NextReader,\nSetReadDeadline, ReadMessage, ReadJSON, SetPongHandler, SetPingHandler)\nconcurrently.\n\nThe Close and WriteControl methods can be called concurrently with all other\nmethods.\n\nWeb browsers allow Javascript applications to open a WebSocket connection to\nany host. It's up to the server to enforce an origin policy using the Origin\nrequest header sent by the browser.\n\nThe Upgrader calls the function specified in the CheckOrigin field to check\nthe origin. If the CheckOrigin function returns false, then the Upgrade\nmethod fails the WebSocket handshake with HTTP status 403.\n\nIf the CheckOrigin field is nil, then the Upgrader uses a safe default: fail\nthe handshake if the Origin request header is present and the Origin host is\nnot equal to the Host request header.\n\nThe deprecated package-level Upgrade function does not perform origin\nchecking. The application is responsible for checking the Origin header\nbefore calling the Upgrade function.\n\nConnections buffer network input and output to reduce the number\nof system calls when reading or writing messages.\n\nWrite buffers are also used for constructing WebSocket frames. See RFC 6455,\nSection 5 for a discussion of message framing. A WebSocket frame header is\nwritten to the network each time a write buffer is flushed to the network.\nDecreasing the size of the write buffer can increase the amount of framing\noverhead on the connection.\n\nThe buffer sizes in bytes are specified by the ReadBufferSize and\nWriteBufferSize fields in the Dialer and Upgrader. The Dialer uses a default\nsize of 4096 when a buffer size field is set to zero. The Upgrader reuses\nbuffers created by the HTTP server when a buffer size field is set to zero.\nThe HTTP server buffers have a size of 4096 at the time of this writing.\n\nThe buffer sizes do not limit the size of a message that can be read or\nwritten by a connection.\n\nBuffers are held for the lifetime of the connection by default. If the\nDialer or Upgrader WriteBufferPool field is set, then a connection holds the\nwrite buffer only when writing a message.\n\nApplications should tune the buffer sizes to balance memory use and\nperformance. Increasing the buffer size uses more memory, but can reduce the\nnumber of system calls to read or write the network. In the case of writing,\nincreasing the buffer size can reduce the number of frame headers written to\nthe network.\n\nSome guidelines for setting buffer parameters are:\n\nLimit the buffer sizes to the maximum expected message size. Buffers larger\nthan the largest message do not provide any benefit.\n\nDepending on the distribution of message sizes, setting the buffer size to\na value less than the maximum expected message size can greatly reduce memory\nuse with a small impact on performance. Here's an example: If 99% of the\nmessages are smaller than 256 bytes and the maximum message size is 512\nbytes, then a buffer size of 256 bytes will result in 1.01 more system calls\nthan a buffer size of 512 bytes. The memory savings is 50%.\n\nA write buffer pool is useful when the application has a modest number\nwrites over a large number of connections. when buffers are pooled, a larger\nbuffer size has a reduced impact on total memory use and has the benefit of\nreducing system calls and frame overhead.\n\nPer message compression extensions (RFC 7692) are experimentally supported\nby this package in a limited capacity. Setting the EnableCompression option\nto true in Dialer or Upgrader will attempt to negotiate per message deflate\nsupport.\n\nIf compression was successfully negotiated with the connection's peer, any\nmessage received in compressed form will be automatically decompressed.\nAll Read methods will return uncompressed bytes.\n\nPer message compression of messages written to a connection can be enabled\nor disabled by calling the corresponding Conn method:\n\nCurrently this package does not support compression with \"context takeover\".\nThis means that messages must be compressed and decompressed in isolation,\nwithout retaining sliding window or dictionary state across messages. For\nmore details refer to RFC 7692.\n\nUse of compression is experimental and may result in decreased performance.",

      "description": "Package pq is a Go PostgreSQL driver for database/sql.\n\nMost clients will use the database/sql package instead of using this package\ndirectly. For example:\n\nYou can also connect with an URL:\n\nSee NewConfig.\n\ndatabase/sql does not dictate any specific format for parameter placeholders,\nand pq uses the PostgreSQL-native ordinal markers ($1, $2, etc.). The same\nplaceholder can be used more than once:\n\npq does not support sql.Result.LastInsertId. Use the RETURNING clause with a\nQuery or QueryRow call instead to return the identifier:\n\nParameters pass through driver.DefaultParameterConverter before they are handled\nby this package. When the binary_parameters connection option is enabled, []byte\nvalues are sent directly to the backend as data in binary format.\n\nThis package returns the following types for values from the PostgreSQL backend:\n\nAll other types are returned directly from the backend as []byte values in text format.\n\npq may return errors of type *pq.Error which contain error details:\n\nYou can perform bulk imports by preparing a statement returned by CopyIn (or\nCopyInSchema) in an explicit transaction (sql.Tx). The returned statement\nhandle can then be repeatedly \"executed\" to copy data into the target table.\nAfter all data has been processed you should call Exec() once with no arguments\nto flush all buffered data. Any call to Exec() might return an error which\nshould be handled appropriately, but because of the internal buffering an error\nreturned by Exec() might not be related to the data passed in the call that\nfailed.\n\nCopyIn uses COPY FROM internally. It is not possible to COPY outside of an\nexplicit transaction in pq.\n\nPostgreSQL supports a simple publish/subscribe model using PostgreSQL's NOTIFY mechanism.\n\nTo start listening for notifications, you first have to open a new connection to\nthe database by calling NewListener. This connection can not be used for\nanything other than LISTEN / NOTIFY. Calling Listen will open a \"notification\nchannel\"; once a notification channel is open, a notification generated on that\nchannel will effect a send on the Listener.Notify channel. A notification\nchannel will remain open until Unlisten is called, though connection loss might\nresult in some notifications being lost. To solve this problem, Listener sends a\nnil pointer over the Notify channel any time the connection is re-established\nfollowing a connection loss. The application can get information about the state\nof the underlying connection by setting an event callback in the call to\nNewListener.\n\nA single Listener can safely be used from concurrent goroutines, which means\nthat there is often no need to create more than one Listener in your\napplication. However, a Listener is always connected to a single database, so\nyou will need to create a new Listener instance for every database you want to\nreceive notifications in.\n\nThe channel name in both Listen and Unlisten is case sensitive, and can contain\nany characters legal in an identifier. Note that the channel name will be\ntruncated to 63 bytes by the PostgreSQL server.\n\nYou can find a complete, working example of Listener usage at cmd/pqlisten.\n\nIf you need support for Kerberos authentication, add the following to your main\npackage:\n\nThis package is in a separate module so that users who don't need Kerberos don't\nhave to add unnecessary dependencies.",

      "description": "Package semver provides the ability to work with Semantic Versions (http://semver.org) in Go.\n\nSpecifically it provides the ability to:\n\nThere are two functions that can parse semantic versions. The `StrictNewVersion`\nfunction only parses valid version 2 semantic versions as outlined in the\nspecification. The `NewVersion` function attempts to coerce a version into a\nsemantic version and parse it. For example, if there is a leading v or a version\nlisted without all 3 parts (e.g. 1.2) it will attempt to coerce it into a valid\nsemantic version (e.g., 1.2.0). In both cases a `Version` object is returned\nthat can be sorted, compared, and used in constraints.\n\nWhen parsing a version an optional error can be returned if there is an issue\nparsing the version. For example,\n\nThe version object has methods to get the parts of the version, compare it to\nother versions, convert the version back into a string, and get the original\nstring. For more details please see the documentation\nat https://godoc.org/github.com/Masterminds/semver.\n\nA set of versions can be sorted using the `sort` package from the standard library.\nFor example,\n\nThere are two methods for comparing versions. One uses comparison methods on\n`Version` instances and the other is using Constraints. There are some important\ndifferences to notes between these two methods of comparison.\n\nThere are differences between the two methods or checking versions because the\ncomparison methods on `Version` follow the specification while comparison ranges\nare not part of the specification. Different packages and tools have taken it\nupon themselves to come up with range rules. This has resulted in differences.\nFor example, npm/js and Cargo/Rust follow similar patterns which PHP has a\ndifferent pattern for ^. The comparison features in this package follow the\nnpm/js and Cargo/Rust lead because applications using it have followed similar\npatters with their versions.\n\nChecking a version against version constraints is one of the most featureful\nparts of the package.\n\nThere are two elements to the comparisons. First, a comparison string is a list\nof comma or space separated AND comparisons. These are then separated by || (OR)\ncomparisons. For example, `\">= 1.2 < 3.0.0 || >= 4.2.3\"` is looking for a\ncomparison that's greater than or equal to 1.2 and less than 3.0.0 or is\ngreater than or equal to 4.2.3. This can also be written as\n`\">= 1.2, < 3.0.0 || >= 4.2.3\"`\n\nThe basic comparisons are:\n\nThere are multiple methods to handle ranges and the first is hyphens ranges.\nThese look like:\n\nThe `x`, `X`, and `*` characters can be used as a wildcard character. This works\nfor all comparison operators. When used on the `=` operator it falls\nback to the tilde operation. For example,\n\nTilde Range Comparisons (Patch)\n\nThe tilde (`~`) comparison operator is for patch level ranges when a minor\nversion is specified and major level changes when the minor number is missing.\nFor example,\n\nCaret Range Comparisons (Major)\n\nThe caret (`^`) comparison operator is for major level changes once a stable\n(1.0.0) release has occurred. Prior to a 1.0.0 release the minor versions acts\nas the API stability level. This is useful when comparisons of API versions as a\nmajor change is API breaking. For example,\n\nIn addition to testing a version against a constraint, a version can be validated\nagainst a constraint. When validation fails a slice of errors containing why a\nversion didn't meet the constraint is returned. For example,",

      "description": "Package digest provides a generalized type to opaquely represent message\ndigests and their operations within the registry. The Digest type is\ndesigned to serve as a flexible identifier in a content-addressable system.\nMore importantly, it provides tools and wrappers to work with\nhash.Hash-based digests with little effort.\n\nThe format of a digest is simply a string with two parts, dubbed the\n\"algorithm\" and the \"digest\", separated by a colon:\n\nAn example of a sha256 digest representation follows:\n\nThe \"algorithm\" portion defines both the hashing algorithm used to calculate\nthe digest and the encoding of the resulting digest, which defaults to \"hex\"\nif not otherwise specified. Currently, all supported algorithms have their\ndigests encoded in hex strings.\n\nIn the example above, the string \"sha256\" is the algorithm and the hex bytes\nare the \"digest\".\n\nBecause the Digest type is simply a string, once a valid Digest is\nobtained, comparisons are cheap, quick and simple to express with the\nstandard equality operator.\n\nThe main benefit of using the Digest type is simple verification against a\ngiven digest. The Verifier interface, modeled after the stdlib hash.Hash\ninterface, provides a common write sink for digest verification. After\nwriting is complete, calling the Verifier.Verified method will indicate\nwhether or not the stream of bytes matches the target digest.\n\nIn addition to the above, we intend to add the following features to this\npackage:\n\n1. A Digester type that supports write sink digest calculation.\n\n2. Suspend and resume of ongoing digest calculations to support efficient digest verification in the registry.",

      "description": "Package errors provides simple error handling primitives.\n\nThe traditional error handling idiom in Go is roughly akin to\n\nwhich when applied recursively up the call stack results in error reports\nwithout context or debugging information. The errors package allows\nprogrammers to add context to the failure path in their code in a way\nthat does not destroy the original value of the error.\n\nThe errors.Wrap function returns a new error that adds context to the\noriginal error by recording a stack trace at the point Wrap is called,\ntogether with the supplied message. For example\n\nIf additional control is required, the errors.WithStack and\nerrors.WithMessage functions destructure errors.Wrap into its component\noperations: annotating an error with a stack trace and with a message,\nrespectively.\n\nUsing errors.Wrap constructs a stack of errors, adding context to the\npreceding error. Depending on the nature of the error it may be necessary\nto reverse the operation of errors.Wrap to retrieve the original error\nfor inspection. Any error value which implements this interface\n\ncan be inspected by errors.Cause. errors.Cause will recursively retrieve\nthe topmost error that does not implement causer, which is assumed to be\nthe original cause. For example:\n\nAlthough the causer interface is not exported by this package, it is\nconsidered a part of its stable public interface.\n\nAll error values returned from this package implement fmt.Formatter and can\nbe formatted by the fmt package. The following verbs are supported:\n\nNew, Errorf, Wrap, and Wrapf record a stack trace at the point they are\ninvoked. This information can be retrieved with the following interface:\n\nThe returned errors.StackTrace type is defined as\n\nThe Frame type represents a call site in the stack trace. Frame supports\nthe fmt.Formatter interface that can be used for printing information about\nthe stack trace of this error. For example:\n\nAlthough the stackTracer interface is not exported by this package, it is\nconsidered a part of its stable public interface.\n\nSee the documentation for Frame.Format for more details.",

      "description": "Package uniseg implements Unicode Text Segmentation, Unicode Line Breaking, and\nstring width calculation for monospace fonts. Unicode Text Segmentation conforms\nto Unicode Standard Annex #29 (https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/) and Unicode\nLine Breaking conforms to Unicode Standard Annex #14\n(https://unicode.org/reports/tr14/).\n\nIn short, using this package, you can split a string into grapheme clusters\n(what people would usually refer to as a \"character\"), into words, and into\nsentences. Or, in its simplest case, this package allows you to count the number\nof characters in a string, especially when it contains complex characters such\nas emojis, combining characters, or characters from Asian, Arabic, Hebrew, or\nother languages. Additionally, you can use it to implement line breaking (or\n\"word wrapping\"), that is, to determine where text can be broken over to the\nnext line when the width of the line is not big enough to fit the entire text.\nFinally, you can use it to calculate the display width of a string for monospace\nfonts.\n\nIf you just want to count the number of characters in a string, you can use\nGraphemeClusterCount. If you want to determine the display width of a string,\nyou can use StringWidth. If you want to iterate over a string, you can use\nStep, StepString, or the Graphemes class (more convenient but less\nperformant). This will provide you with all information: grapheme clusters,\nword boundaries, sentence boundaries, line breaks, and monospace character\nwidths. The specialized functions FirstGraphemeCluster,\nFirstGraphemeClusterInString, FirstWord, FirstWordInString,\nFirstSentence, and FirstSentenceInString can be used if only one type of\ninformation is needed.\n\nConsider the rainbow flag emoji: 🏳️‍🌈. On most modern systems, it appears as one\ncharacter. But its string representation actually has 14 bytes, so counting\nbytes (or using len(\"🏳️‍🌈\")) will not work as expected. Counting runes won't,\neither: The flag has 4 Unicode code points, thus 4 runes. The stdlib function\nutf8.RuneCountInString(\"🏳️‍🌈\") and len([]rune(\"🏳️‍🌈\")) will both return 4.\n\nThe GraphemeClusterCount function will return 1 for the rainbow flag emoji.\nThe Graphemes class and a variety of functions in this package will allow you to\nsplit strings into its grapheme clusters.\n\nWord boundaries are used in a number of different contexts. The most familiar\nones are selection (double-click mouse selection), cursor movement (\"move to\nnext word\" control-arrow keys), and the dialog option \"Whole Word Search\" for\nsearch and replace. This package provides methods for determining word\nboundaries.\n\nSentence boundaries are often used for triple-click or some other method of\nselecting or iterating through blocks of text that are larger than single words.\nThey are also used to determine whether words occur within the same sentence in\ndatabase queries. This package provides methods for determining sentence\nboundaries.\n\nLine breaking, also known as word wrapping, is the process of breaking a section\nof text into lines such that it will fit in the available width of a page,\nwindow or other display area. This package provides methods to determine the\npositions in a string where a line must be broken, may be broken, or must not be\nbroken.\n\nMonospace width, as referred to in this package, is the width of a string in a\nmonospace font. This is commonly used in terminal user interfaces or text\ndisplays or editors that don't support proportional fonts. A width of 1\ncorresponds to a single character cell. The C function wcswidth() and its\nimplementation in other programming languages is in widespread use for the same\npurpose. However, there is no standard for the calculation of such widths, and\nthis package differs from wcswidth() in a number of ways, presumably to generate\nmore visually pleasing results.\n\nTo start, we assume that every code point has a width of 1, with the following\nexceptions:\n\nFor Hangul grapheme clusters composed of conjoining Jamo and for Regional\nIndicators (flags), all code points except the first one have a width of 0. For\ngrapheme clusters starting with an Extended Pictographic, any additional code\npoint will force a total width of 2, except if the Variation Selector-15\n(U+FE0E) is included, in which case the total width is always 1. Grapheme\nclusters ending with Variation Selector-16 (U+FE0F) have a width of 2.\n\nNote that whether these widths appear correct depends on your application's\nrender engine, to which extent it conforms to the Unicode Standard, and its\nchoice of font.",

      "description": "SQL Schema migration tool for Go.\n\nKey features:\n\nTo install the library and command line program, use the following:\n\nThe main command is called sql-migrate.\n\nEach command requires a configuration file (which defaults to dbconfig.yml, but can be specified with the -config flag). This config file should specify one or more environments:\n\nThe `table` setting is optional and will default to `gorp_migrations`.\n\nThe environment that will be used can be specified with the -env flag (defaults to development).\n\nUse the --help flag in combination with any of the commands to get an overview of its usage:\n\nThe up command applies all available migrations. By contrast, down will only apply one migration by default. This behavior can be changed for both by using the -limit parameter.\n\nThe redo command will unapply the last migration and reapply it. This is useful during development, when you're writing migrations.\n\nUse the status command to see the state of the applied migrations:\n\nIf you are using MySQL, you must append ?parseTime=true to the datasource configuration. For example:\n\nSee https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#parsetime for more information.\n\nImport sql-migrate into your application:\n\nSet up a source of migrations, this can be from memory, from a set of files or from bindata (more on that later):\n\nThen use the Exec function to upgrade your database:\n\nNote that n can be greater than 0 even if there is an error: any migration that succeeded will remain applied even if a later one fails.\n\nThe full set of capabilities can be found in the API docs below.\n\nMigrations are defined in SQL files, which contain a set of SQL statements. Special comments are used to distinguish up and down migrations.\n\nYou can put multiple statements in each block, as long as you end them with a semicolon (;).\n\nIf you have complex statements which contain semicolons, use StatementBegin and StatementEnd to indicate boundaries:\n\nThe order in which migrations are applied is defined through the filename: sql-migrate will sort migrations based on their name. It's recommended to use an increasing version number or a timestamp as the first part of the filename.\n\nNormally each migration is run within a transaction in order to guarantee that it is fully atomic. However some SQL commands (for example creating an index concurrently in PostgreSQL) cannot be executed inside a transaction. In order to execute such a command in a migration, the migration can be run using the notransaction option:\n\nIf you like your Go applications self-contained (that is: a single binary): use packr (https://github.com/gobuffalo/packr) to embed the migration files.\n\nJust write your migration files as usual, as a set of SQL files in a folder.\n\nUse the PackrMigrationSource in your application to find the migrations:\n\nIf you already have a box and would like to use a subdirectory:\n\nAs an alternative, but slightly less maintained, you can use bindata (https://github.com/shuLhan/go-bindata) to embed the migration files.\n\nJust write your migration files as usual, as a set of SQL files in a folder.\n\nThen use bindata to generate a .go file with the migrations embedded:\n\nThe resulting bindata.go file will contain your migrations. Remember to regenerate your bindata.go file whenever you add/modify a migration (go generate will help here, once it arrives).\n\nUse the AssetMigrationSource in your application to find the migrations:\n\nBoth Asset and AssetDir are functions provided by bindata.\n\nThen proceed as usual.\n\nAdding a new migration source means implementing MigrationSource.\n\nThe resulting slice of migrations will be executed in the given order, so it should usually be sorted by the Id field.",

      "description": "Package blackfriday is a markdown processor.\n\nIt translates plain text with simple formatting rules into an AST, which can\nthen be further processed to HTML (provided by Blackfriday itself) or other\nformats (provided by the community).\n\nThe simplest way to invoke Blackfriday is to call the Run function. It will\ntake a text input and produce a text output in HTML (or other format).\n\nA slightly more sophisticated way to use Blackfriday is to create a Markdown\nprocessor and to call Parse, which returns a syntax tree for the input\ndocument. You can leverage Blackfriday's parsing for content extraction from\nmarkdown documents. You can assign a custom renderer and set various options\nto the Markdown processor.\n\nIf you're interested in calling Blackfriday from command line, see\nhttps://github.com/russross/blackfriday-tool.\n\nBlackfriday includes an algorithm for creating sanitized anchor names\ncorresponding to a given input text. This algorithm is used to create\nanchors for headings when AutoHeadingIDs extension is enabled. The\nalgorithm is specified below, so that other packages can create\ncompatible anchor names and links to those anchors.\n\nThe algorithm iterates over the input text, interpreted as UTF-8,\none Unicode code point (rune) at a time. All runes that are letters (category L)\nor numbers (category N) are considered valid characters. They are mapped to\nlower case, and included in the output. All other runes are considered\ninvalid characters. Invalid characters that precede the first valid character,\nas well as invalid character that follow the last valid character\nare dropped completely. All other sequences of invalid characters\nbetween two valid characters are replaced with a single dash character '-'.\n\nSanitizedAnchorName exposes this functionality, and can be used to\ncreate compatible links to the anchor names generated by blackfriday.\nThis algorithm is also implemented in a small standalone package at\ngithub.com/shurcooL/sanitized_anchor_name. It can be useful for clients\nthat want a small package and don't need full functionality of blackfriday.",

      "description": "Package pflag is a drop-in replacement for Go's flag package, implementing\nPOSIX/GNU-style --flags.\n\npflag is compatible with the GNU extensions to the POSIX recommendations\nfor command-line options. See\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argument-Syntax.html\n\nUsage:\n\npflag is a drop-in replacement of Go's native flag package. If you import\npflag under the name \"flag\" then all code should continue to function\nwith no changes.\n\nThere is one exception to this: if you directly instantiate the Flag struct\nthere is one more field \"Shorthand\" that you will need to set.\nMost code never instantiates this struct directly, and instead uses\nfunctions such as String(), BoolVar(), and Var(), and is therefore\nunaffected.\n\nDefine flags using flag.String(), Bool(), Int(), etc.\n\nThis declares an integer flag, -flagname, stored in the pointer ip, with type *int.\n\nIf you like, you can bind the flag to a variable using the Var() functions.\n\nOr you can create custom flags that satisfy the Value interface (with\npointer receivers) and couple them to flag parsing by\n\nFor such flags, the default value is just the initial value of the variable.\n\nAfter all flags are defined, call\n\nto parse the command line into the defined flags.\n\nFlags may then be used directly. If you're using the flags themselves,\nthey are all pointers; if you bind to variables, they're values.\n\nAfter parsing, the arguments after the flag are available as the\nslice flag.Args() or individually as flag.Arg(i).\nThe arguments are indexed from 0 through flag.NArg()-1.\n\nThe pflag package also defines some new functions that are not in flag,\nthat give one-letter shorthands for flags. You can use these by appending\n'P' to the name of any function that defines a flag.\n\nShorthand letters can be used with single dashes on the command line.\nBoolean shorthand flags can be combined with other shorthand flags.\n\nCommand line flag syntax:\n\nUnlike the flag package, a single dash before an option means something\ndifferent than a double dash. Single dashes signify a series of shorthand\nletters for flags. All but the last shorthand letter must be boolean flags.\n\nFlag parsing stops after the terminator \"--\". Unlike the flag package,\nflags can be interspersed with arguments anywhere on the command line\nbefore this terminator.\n\nInteger flags accept 1234, 0664, 0x1234 and may be negative.\nBoolean flags (in their long form) accept 1, 0, t, f, true, false,\nTRUE, FALSE, True, False.\nDuration flags accept any input valid for time.ParseDuration.\n\nThe default set of command-line flags is controlled by\ntop-level functions.  The FlagSet type allows one to define\nindependent sets of flags, such as to implement subcommands\nin a command-line interface. The methods of FlagSet are\nanalogous to the top-level functions for the command-line\nflag set.",

      "description": "Package metric provides the OpenTelemetry API used to measure metrics about\nsource code operation.\n\nThis API is separate from its implementation so the instrumentation built from\nit is reusable. See go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric for the official\nOpenTelemetry implementation of this API.\n\nAll measurements made with this package are made via instruments. These\ninstruments are created by a Meter which itself is created by a\nMeterProvider. Applications need to accept a MeterProvider implementation\nas a starting point when instrumenting. This can be done directly, or by using\nthe OpenTelemetry global MeterProvider via GetMeterProvider. Using an\nappropriately named Meter from the accepted MeterProvider, instrumentation\ncan then be built from the Meter's instruments.\n\nEach instrument is designed to make measurements of a particular type. Broadly,\nall instruments fall into two overlapping logical categories: asynchronous or\nsynchronous, and int64 or float64.\n\nAll synchronous instruments (Int64Counter, Int64UpDownCounter,\nInt64Histogram, Float64Counter, Float64UpDownCounter, and\nFloat64Histogram) are used to measure the operation and performance of source\ncode during the source code execution. These instruments only make measurements\nwhen the source code they instrument is run.\n\nAll asynchronous instruments (Int64ObservableCounter,\nInt64ObservableUpDownCounter, Int64ObservableGauge,\nFloat64ObservableCounter, Float64ObservableUpDownCounter, and\nFloat64ObservableGauge) are used to measure metrics outside of the execution\nof source code. They are said to make \"observations\" via a callback function\ncalled once every measurement collection cycle.\n\nEach instrument is also grouped by the value type it measures. Either int64 or\nfloat64. The value being measured will dictate which instrument in these\ncategories to use.\n\nOutside of these two broad categories, instruments are described by the\nfunction they are designed to serve. All Counters (Int64Counter,\nFloat64Counter, Int64ObservableCounter, and Float64ObservableCounter) are\ndesigned to measure values that never decrease in value, but instead only\nincrementally increase in value. UpDownCounters (Int64UpDownCounter,\nFloat64UpDownCounter, Int64ObservableUpDownCounter, and\nFloat64ObservableUpDownCounter) on the other hand, are designed to measure\nvalues that can increase and decrease. When more information needs to be\nconveyed about all the synchronous measurements made during a collection cycle,\na Histogram (Int64Histogram and Float64Histogram) should be used. Finally,\nwhen just the most recent measurement needs to be conveyed about an\nasynchronous measurement, a Gauge (Int64ObservableGauge and\nFloat64ObservableGauge) should be used.\n\nSee the OpenTelemetry documentation for more information about instruments\nand their intended use.\n\nOpenTelemetry defines an instrument name syntax that restricts what\ninstrument names are allowed.\n\nInstrument names should ...\n\nTo ensure compatibility with observability platforms, all instruments created\nneed to conform to this syntax. Not all implementations of the API will validate\nthese names, it is the callers responsibility to ensure compliance.\n\nMeasurements are made by recording values and information about the values with\nan instrument. How these measurements are recorded depends on the instrument.\n\nMeasurements for synchronous instruments (Int64Counter, Int64UpDownCounter,\nInt64Histogram, Float64Counter, Float64UpDownCounter, and\nFloat64Histogram) are recorded using the instrument methods directly. All\ncounter instruments have an Add method that is used to measure an increment\nvalue, and all histogram instruments have a Record method to measure a data\npoint.\n\nAsynchronous instruments (Int64ObservableCounter,\nInt64ObservableUpDownCounter, Int64ObservableGauge,\nFloat64ObservableCounter, Float64ObservableUpDownCounter, and\nFloat64ObservableGauge) record measurements within a callback function. The\ncallback is registered with the Meter which ensures the callback is called once\nper collection cycle. A callback can be registered two ways: during the\ninstrument's creation using an option, or later using the RegisterCallback\nmethod of the Meter that created the instrument.\n\nIf the following criteria are met, an option (WithInt64Callback or\nWithFloat64Callback) can be used during the asynchronous instrument's\ncreation to register a callback (Int64Callback or Float64Callback,\nrespectively):\n\nIf the criteria are not met, use the RegisterCallback method of the Meter that\ncreated the instrument to register a Callback.\n\nThis package does not conform to the standard Go versioning policy, all of its\ninterfaces may have methods added to them without a package major version bump.\nThis non-standard API evolution could surprise an uninformed implementation\nauthor. They could unknowingly build their implementation in a way that would\nresult in a runtime panic for their users that update to the new API.\n\nThe API is designed to help inform an instrumentation author about this\nnon-standard API evolution. It requires them to choose a default behavior for\nunimplemented interface methods. There are three behavior choices they can\nmake:\n\nAll interfaces in this API embed a corresponding interface from\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/embedded. If an author wants the default\nbehavior of their implementations to be a compilation failure, signaling to\ntheir users they need to update to the latest version of that implementation,\nthey need to embed the corresponding interface from\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/embedded in their implementation. For\nexample,\n\nIf an author wants the default behavior of their implementations to a panic,\nthey need to embed the API interface directly.\n\nThis is not a recommended behavior as it could lead to publishing packages that\ncontain runtime panics when users update other package that use newer versions\nof go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric.\n\nFinally, an author can embed another implementation in theirs. The embedded\nimplementation will be used for methods not defined by the author. For example,\nan author who wants to default to silently dropping the call can use\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/noop:\n\nIt is strongly recommended that authors only embed\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/noop if they choose this default behavior.\nThat implementation is the only one OpenTelemetry authors can guarantee will\nfully implement all the API interfaces when a user updates their API.",

      "description": "Package trace provides an implementation of the tracing part of the\nOpenTelemetry API.\n\nTo participate in distributed traces a Span needs to be created for the\noperation being performed as part of a traced workflow. In its simplest form:\n\nA Tracer is unique to the instrumentation and is used to create Spans.\nInstrumentation should be designed to accept a TracerProvider from which it\ncan create its own unique Tracer. Alternatively, the registered global\nTracerProvider from the go.opentelemetry.io/otel package can be used as\na default.\n\nThis package does not conform to the standard Go versioning policy; all of its\ninterfaces may have methods added to them without a package major version bump.\nThis non-standard API evolution could surprise an uninformed implementation\nauthor. They could unknowingly build their implementation in a way that would\nresult in a runtime panic for their users that update to the new API.\n\nThe API is designed to help inform an instrumentation author about this\nnon-standard API evolution. It requires them to choose a default behavior for\nunimplemented interface methods. There are three behavior choices they can\nmake:\n\nAll interfaces in this API embed a corresponding interface from\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace/embedded. If an author wants the default\nbehavior of their implementations to be a compilation failure, signaling to\ntheir users they need to update to the latest version of that implementation,\nthey need to embed the corresponding interface from\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace/embedded in their implementation. For\nexample,\n\nIf an author wants the default behavior of their implementations to panic, they\ncan embed the API interface directly.\n\nThis option is not recommended. It will lead to publishing packages that\ncontain runtime panics when users update to newer versions of\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace, which may be done with a transitive\ndependency.\n\nFinally, an author can embed another implementation in theirs. The embedded\nimplementation will be used for methods not defined by the author. For example,\nan author who wants to default to silently dropping the call can use\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace/noop:\n\nIt is strongly recommended that authors only embed\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace/noop if they choose this default behavior.\nThat implementation is the only one OpenTelemetry authors can guarantee will\nfully implement all the API interfaces when a user updates their API.",

      "description": "Package zap provides fast, structured, leveled logging.\n\nFor applications that log in the hot path, reflection-based serialization\nand string formatting are prohibitively expensive - they're CPU-intensive\nand make many small allocations. Put differently, using json.Marshal and\nfmt.Fprintf to log tons of interface{} makes your application slow.\n\nZap takes a different approach. It includes a reflection-free,\nzero-allocation JSON encoder, and the base Logger strives to avoid\nserialization overhead and allocations wherever possible. By building the\nhigh-level SugaredLogger on that foundation, zap lets users choose when\nthey need to count every allocation and when they'd prefer a more familiar,\nloosely typed API.\n\nIn contexts where performance is nice, but not critical, use the\nSugaredLogger. It's 4-10x faster than other structured logging packages and\nsupports both structured and printf-style logging. Like log15 and go-kit,\nthe SugaredLogger's structured logging APIs are loosely typed and accept a\nvariadic number of key-value pairs. (For more advanced use cases, they also\naccept strongly typed fields - see the SugaredLogger.With documentation for\ndetails.)\n\nBy default, loggers are unbuffered. However, since zap's low-level APIs\nallow buffering, calling Sync before letting your process exit is a good\nhabit.\n\nIn the rare contexts where every microsecond and every allocation matter,\nuse the Logger. It's even faster than the SugaredLogger and allocates far\nless, but it only supports strongly-typed, structured logging.\n\nChoosing between the Logger and SugaredLogger doesn't need to be an\napplication-wide decision: converting between the two is simple and\ninexpensive.\n\nThe simplest way to build a Logger is to use zap's opinionated presets:\nNewExample, NewProduction, and NewDevelopment. These presets build a logger\nwith a single function call:\n\nPresets are fine for small projects, but larger projects and organizations\nnaturally require a bit more customization. For most users, zap's Config\nstruct strikes the right balance between flexibility and convenience. See\nthe package-level BasicConfiguration example for sample code.\n\nMore unusual configurations (splitting output between files, sending logs\nto a message queue, etc.) are possible, but require direct use of\ngo.uber.org/zap/zapcore. See the package-level AdvancedConfiguration\nexample for sample code.\n\nThe zap package itself is a relatively thin wrapper around the interfaces\nin go.uber.org/zap/zapcore. Extending zap to support a new encoding (e.g.,\nBSON), a new log sink (e.g., Kafka), or something more exotic (perhaps an\nexception aggregation service, like Sentry or Rollbar) typically requires\nimplementing the zapcore.Encoder, zapcore.WriteSyncer, or zapcore.Core\ninterfaces. See the zapcore documentation for details.\n\nSimilarly, package authors can use the high-performance Encoder and Core\nimplementations in the zapcore package to build their own loggers.\n\nAn FAQ covering everything from installation errors to design decisions is\navailable at https://github.com/uber-go/zap/blob/master/FAQ.md.",

      "description": "Package apiserver provides the machinery for building Kubernetes-style API servers.\n\nThis library is the foundation for the Kubernetes API server (`kube-apiserver`),\nand is also the primary framework for developers building custom API servers to extend\nthe Kubernetes API.\n\nAn extension API server is a user-provided, standalone web server that registers itself\nwith the main kube-apiserver to handle specific API groups. This allows developers to\nextend Kubernetes with their own APIs that behave like core Kubernetes APIs, complete\nwith typed clients, authentication, authorization, and discovery.\n\nThe `apiserver` library is composed of several key packages:\n\nThe `GenericAPIServer` struct is the heart of any extension server. It is responsible\nfor assembling and running the HTTP serving stack. See the runnable example for a\ndemonstration of how to instantiate a `GenericAPIServer`.\n\nThe mechanism that enables extension API servers is API aggregation. The\nprimary apiserver (typically the kube-apiserver) acts as a proxy, forwarding\nrequests for a specific API group (e.g., /apis/myextension.io/v1) to a\nregistered extension server. The apiserver is configured using\nAPIService objects.\n\nFor most use cases, custom resources (CustomResourceDefinitions) are the\npreferred way to extend the Kubernetes API.\n\nThe `pkg/admission` package provides a way to add admission policies directly\ninto an apiserver. Admission plugins can be used to validate or mutate objects\nduring write operations. The kube-apiserver uses admission plugins to provide\na variety of core system capabilities.\n\nFor most extension use cases dynamic admission control using policies\n(ValidatingAdmissionPolicies or MutatingAdmissionPolicies) or\nwebhooks (ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and MutatingWebhookConfiguration) are the\npreferred way to extend admission control.",

It provides\na standard set of clients and tools for building applications, controllers,\nand operators that communicate with a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nkubernetes: Contains the typed Clientset for interacting with built-in,\nversioned API objects (e.g., Pods, Deployments). This is the most common\nstarting point.\n\ndynamic: Provides a dynamic client that can perform operations on any\nKubernetes object, including Custom Resources (CRs). It is essential for\nbuilding controllers that work with CRDs.\n\ndiscovery: Used to discover the API groups, versions, and resources\nsupported by a Kubernetes cluster.\n\ntools/cache: The foundation of the controller pattern. This package provides\nefficient caching and synchronization mechanisms (Informers and Listers)\nfor building controllers.\n\ntools/clientcmd: Provides methods for loading client configuration from\nkubeconfig files. This is essential for out-of-cluster applications and CLI tools.\n\nrest: Provides a lower-level RESTClient that manages the details of\ncommunicating with the Kubernetes API server. It is useful for advanced\nuse cases that require fine-grained control over requests, such as working\nwith non-standard REST verbs.\n\nThere are two primary ways to configure a client to connect to the API server:\n\nIn-Cluster Configuration: For applications running inside a Kubernetes pod,\nthe `rest.InClusterConfig()` function provides a straightforward way to\nconfigure the client. It automatically uses the pod's service account for\nauthentication and is the recommended approach for controllers and operators.\n\nOut-of-Cluster Configuration: For local development or command-line tools,\nthe `clientcmd` package is used to load configuration from a\nkubeconfig file.\n\nThe `rest.Config` object allows for fine-grained control over client-side\nperformance and reliability. Key settings include:\n\nOnce configured, a client can be used to interact with objects in the cluster.\n\nThe Typed Clientset (`kubernetes` package) provides a strongly typed\ninterface for working with built-in Kubernetes objects.\n\nThe Dynamic Client (`dynamic` package) can work with any object, including\nCustom Resources, using `unstructured.Unstructured` types.\n\nFor Custom Resources (CRDs), the `k8s.io/code-generator` repository\ncontains the tools to generate typed clients, informers, and listers. The\n`sample-controller` is the canonical example of this pattern.\n\nServer-Side Apply is a patching strategy that allows multiple actors to\nshare management of an object by tracking field ownership. This prevents\nactors from inadvertently overwriting each other's changes and provides\na mechanism for resolving conflicts. The `applyconfigurations` package\nprovides the necessary tools for this declarative approach.\n\nRobust error handling is essential when interacting with the API. The\n`k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/api/errors` package provides functions to inspect\nerrors and check for common conditions, such as whether a resource was not\nfound or already exists. This allows controllers to implement robust,\nidempotent reconciliation logic.\n\nThe controller pattern is central to Kubernetes. A controller observes the\nstate of the cluster and works to bring it to the desired state.\n\nThe `tools/cache` package provides the building blocks for this pattern.\nInformers watch the API server and maintain a local cache, Listers provide\nread-only access to the cache, and Workqueues decouple event detection\nfrom processing.\n\nIn a high-availability deployment where multiple instances of a controller\nare running, leader election (`tools/leaderelection`) is used to ensure\nthat only one instance is active at a time.\n\nClient-side feature gates allow for enabling or disabling experimental\nfeatures in `client-go`. They can be configured via the `rest.Config` object.",

      "description": "Package controllerruntime provides tools to construct Kubernetes-style\ncontrollers that manipulate both Kubernetes CRDs and aggregated/built-in\nKubernetes APIs.\n\nIt defines easy helpers for the common use cases when building CRDs, built\non top of customizable layers of abstraction.  Common cases should be easy,\nand uncommon cases should be possible.  In general, controller-runtime tries\nto guide users towards Kubernetes controller best-practices.\n\nThe main entrypoint for controller-runtime is this root package, which\ncontains all of the common types needed to get started building controllers:\n\nThe examples in this package walk through a basic controller setup.  The\nkubebuilder book (https://book.kubebuilder.io) has some more in-depth\nwalkthroughs.\n\ncontroller-runtime favors structs with sane defaults over constructors, so\nit's fairly common to see structs being used directly in controller-runtime.\n\nA brief-ish walkthrough of the layout of this library can be found below. Each\npackage contains more information about how to use it.\n\nFrequently asked questions about using controller-runtime and designing\ncontrollers can be found at\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/blob/main/FAQ.md.\n\nEvery controller and webhook is ultimately run by a Manager (pkg/manager). A\nmanager is responsible for running controllers and webhooks, and setting up\ncommon dependencies, like shared caches and clients, as\nwell as managing leader election (pkg/leaderelection).  Managers are\ngenerally configured to gracefully shut down controllers on pod termination\nby wiring up a signal handler (pkg/manager/signals).\n\nControllers (pkg/controller) use events (pkg/event) to eventually trigger\nreconcile requests.  They may be constructed manually, but are often\nconstructed with a Builder (pkg/builder), which eases the wiring of event\nsources (pkg/source), like Kubernetes API object changes, to event handlers\n(pkg/handler), like \"enqueue a reconcile request for the object owner\".\nPredicates (pkg/predicate) can be used to filter which events actually\ntrigger reconciles.  There are pre-written utilities for the common cases, and\ninterfaces and helpers for advanced cases.\n\nController logic is implemented in terms of Reconcilers (pkg/reconcile).  A\nReconciler implements a function which takes a reconcile Request containing\nthe name and namespace of the object to reconcile, reconciles the object,\nand returns a Response or an error indicating whether to requeue for a\nsecond round of processing.\n\nReconcilers use Clients (pkg/client) to access API objects.  The default\nclient provided by the manager reads from a local shared cache (pkg/cache)\nand writes directly to the API server, but clients can be constructed that\nonly talk to the API server, without a cache.  The Cache will auto-populate\nwith watched objects, as well as when other structured objects are\nrequested. The default split client does not promise to invalidate the cache\nduring writes (nor does it promise sequential create/get coherence), and code\nshould not assume a get immediately following a create/update will return\nthe updated resource. Caches may also have indexes, which can be created via\na FieldIndexer (pkg/client) obtained from the manager.  Indexes can be used to\nquickly and easily look up all objects with certain fields set.  Reconcilers\nmay retrieve event recorders (pkg/recorder) to emit events using the\nmanager.\n\nClients, Caches, and many other things in Kubernetes use Schemes\n(pkg/scheme) to associate Go types to Kubernetes API Kinds\n(Group-Version-Kinds, to be specific).\n\nSimilarly, webhooks (pkg/webhook/admission) may be implemented directly, but\nare often constructed using a builder (pkg/webhook/admission/builder).  They\nare run via a server (pkg/webhook) which is managed by a Manager.\n\nLogging (pkg/log) in controller-runtime is done via structured logs, using a\nlog set of interfaces called logr\n(https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-logr/logr).  While controller-runtime\nprovides easy setup for using Zap (https://go.uber.org/zap, pkg/log/zap),\nyou can provide any implementation of logr as the base logger for\ncontroller-runtime.\n\nMetrics (pkg/metrics) provided by controller-runtime are registered into a\ncontroller-runtime-specific Prometheus metrics registry.  The manager can\nserve these by an HTTP endpoint, and additional metrics may be registered to\nthis Registry as normal.\n\nYou can easily build integration and unit tests for your controllers and\nwebhooks using the test Environment (pkg/envtest).  This will automatically\nstand up a copy of etcd and kube-apiserver, and provide the correct options\nto connect to the API server.  It's designed to work well with the Ginkgo\ntesting framework, but should work with any testing setup.\n\nThis example creates a simple application Controller that is configured for ReplicaSets and Pods.\n\n* Create a new application for ReplicaSets that manages Pods owned by the ReplicaSet and calls into\nReplicaSetReconciler.\n\n* Start the application.\n\n\nThis example creates a simple application Controller that is configured for ExampleCRDWithConfigMapRef CRD.\nAny change in the configMap referenced in this Custom Resource will cause the re-reconcile of the parent ExampleCRDWithConfigMapRef\ndue to the implementation of the .Watches method of \"sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/builder\".Builder.\n\n\nThis example creates a simple application Controller that is configured for ReplicaSets and Pods.\nThis application controller will be running leader election with the provided configuration in the manager options.\nIf leader election configuration is not provided, controller runs leader election with default values.\nDefault values taken from: https://github.com/kubernetes/component-base/blob/master/config/v1alpha1/defaults.go\n* defaultLeaseDuration = 15 * time.Second\n* defaultRenewDeadline = 10 * time.Second\n* defaultRetryPeriod   = 2 * time.Second\n\n* Create a new application for ReplicaSets that manages Pods owned by the ReplicaSet and calls into\nReplicaSetReconciler.\n\n* Start the application.",
