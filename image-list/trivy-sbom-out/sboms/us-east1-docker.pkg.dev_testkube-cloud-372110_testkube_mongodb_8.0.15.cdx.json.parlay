The block format is the Decode and Encode\nfunctions and the stream format is the Reader and Writer types.\n\nThe block format, the more common case, is used when the complete size (the\nnumber of bytes) of the original data is known upfront, at the time\ncompression starts. The stream format, also known as the framing format, is\nfor when that isn't always true.\n\nThe canonical, C++ implementation is at https://github.com/google/snappy and\nit only implements the block format.",

      "version": "v1.17.0",
      "description": "Package azcore implements an HTTP request/response middleware pipeline used by Azure SDK clients.\n\nThe middleware consists of three components.\n\nA Policy can be implemented in two ways; as a first-class function for a stateless Policy, or as\na method on a type for a stateful Policy.  Note that HTTP requests made via the same pipeline share\nthe same Policy instances, so if a Policy mutates its state it MUST be properly synchronized to\navoid race conditions.\n\nA Policy's Do method is called when an HTTP request wants to be sent over the network. The Do method can\nperform any operation(s) it desires. For example, it can log the outgoing request, mutate the URL, headers,\nand/or query parameters, inject a failure, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its request\nwork, it must call the Next() method on the *policy.Request instance in order to pass the request to the\nnext Policy in the chain.\n\nWhen an HTTP response comes back, the Policy then gets a chance to process the response/error.  The Policy instance\ncan log the response, retry the operation if it failed due to a transient error or timeout, unmarshal the response\nbody, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its response work, it must return the *http.Response\nand error instances to its caller.\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateless Policy:\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateful Policy:\n\nThe Transporter interface is responsible for sending the HTTP request and returning the corresponding\nHTTP response or error.  The Transporter is invoked by the last Policy in the chain.  The default Transporter\nimplementation uses a shared http.Client from the standard library.\n\nThe same stateful/stateless rules for Policy implementations apply to Transporter implementations.\n\nTo use the Policy and Transporter instances, an application passes them to the runtime.NewPipeline function.\n\nThe specified Policy instances form a chain and are invoked in the order provided to NewPipeline\nfollowed by the Transporter.\n\nOnce the Pipeline has been created, create a runtime.Request instance and pass it to Pipeline's Do method.\n\nThe Pipeline.Do method sends the specified Request through the chain of Policy and Transporter\ninstances.  The response/error is then sent through the same chain of Policy instances in reverse\norder.  For example, assuming there are Policy types PolicyA, PolicyB, and PolicyC along with\nTransportA.\n\nThe flow of Request and Response looks like the following:\n\nThe Request instance passed to Pipeline's Do method is a wrapper around an *http.Request.  It also\ncontains some internal state and provides various convenience methods.  You create a Request instance\nby calling the runtime.NewRequest function:\n\nIf the Request should contain a body, call the SetBody method.\n\nA seekable stream is required so that upon retry, the retry Policy instance can seek the stream\nback to the beginning before retrying the network request and re-uploading the body.\n\nOperations like JSON-MERGE-PATCH send a JSON null to indicate a value should be deleted.\n\nThis requirement conflicts with the SDK's default marshalling that specifies \"omitempty\" as\na means to resolve the ambiguity between a field to be excluded and its zero-value.\n\nIn the above example, Name and Count are defined as pointer-to-type to disambiguate between\na missing value (nil) and a zero-value (0) which might have semantic differences.\n\nIn a PATCH operation, any fields left as nil are to have their values preserved.  When updating\na Widget's count, one simply specifies the new value for Count, leaving Name nil.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement for sending a JSON null, the NullValue() function can be used.\n\nThis sends an explict \"null\" for Count, indicating that any current value for Count should be deleted.\n\nWhen the HTTP response is received, the *http.Response is returned directly. Each Policy instance\ncan inspect/mutate the *http.Response.\n\nTo enable logging, set environment variable AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING to \"all\" before executing your program.\n\nBy default the logger writes to stderr.  This can be customized by calling log.SetListener, providing\na callback that writes to the desired location.  Any custom logging implementation MUST provide its\nown synchronization to handle concurrent invocations.\n\nSee the docs for the log package for further details.\n\nPageable operations return potentially large data sets spread over multiple GET requests.  The result of\neach GET is a \"page\" of data consisting of a slice of items.\n\nPageable operations can be identified by their New*Pager naming convention and return type of *runtime.Pager[T].\n\nThe call to WidgetClient.NewListWidgetsPager() returns an instance of *runtime.Pager[T] for fetching pages\nand determining if there are more pages to fetch.  No IO calls are made until the NextPage() method is invoked.\n\nLong-running operations (LROs) are operations consisting of an initial request to start the operation followed\nby polling to determine when the operation has reached a terminal state.  An LRO's terminal state is one\nof the following values.\n\nLROs can be identified by their Begin* prefix and their return type of *runtime.Poller[T].\n\nWhen a call to WidgetClient.BeginCreateOrUpdate() returns a nil error, it means that the LRO has started.\nIt does _not_ mean that the widget has been created or updated (or failed to be created/updated).\n\nThe *runtime.Poller[T] provides APIs for determining the state of the LRO.  To wait for the LRO to complete,\ncall the PollUntilDone() method.\n\nThe call to PollUntilDone() will block the current goroutine until the LRO has reached a terminal state or the\ncontext is canceled/timed out.\n\nNote that LROs can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  The duration is operation-dependent.  Due to\nthis variant behavior, pollers do _not_ have a preconfigured time-out.  Use a context with the appropriate cancellation\nmechanism as required.\n\nPollers provide the ability to serialize their state into a \"resume token\" which can be used by another process to\nrecreate the poller.  This is achieved via the runtime.Poller[T].ResumeToken() method.\n\nNote that a token can only be obtained for a poller that's in a non-terminal state.  Also note that any subsequent calls\nto poller.Poll() might change the poller's state.  In this case, a new token should be created.\n\nAfter the token has been obtained, it can be used to recreate an instance of the originating poller.\n\nWhen resuming a poller, no IO is performed, and zero-value arguments can be used for everything but the Options.ResumeToken.\n\nResume tokens are unique per service client and operation.  Attempting to resume a poller for LRO BeginB() with a token from LRO\nBeginA() will result in an error.\n\nThe fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.\nThis allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.\n\nPlease see https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/samples/fakes for details and examples on how to use fakes.",

      "description": "Package azcore implements an HTTP request/response middleware pipeline used by Azure SDK clients.\n\nThe middleware consists of three components.\n\nA Policy can be implemented in two ways; as a first-class function for a stateless Policy, or as\na method on a type for a stateful Policy.  Note that HTTP requests made via the same pipeline share\nthe same Policy instances, so if a Policy mutates its state it MUST be properly synchronized to\navoid race conditions.\n\nA Policy's Do method is called when an HTTP request wants to be sent over the network. The Do method can\nperform any operation(s) it desires. For example, it can log the outgoing request, mutate the URL, headers,\nand/or query parameters, inject a failure, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its request\nwork, it must call the Next() method on the *policy.Request instance in order to pass the request to the\nnext Policy in the chain.\n\nWhen an HTTP response comes back, the Policy then gets a chance to process the response/error.  The Policy instance\ncan log the response, retry the operation if it failed due to a transient error or timeout, unmarshal the response\nbody, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its response work, it must return the *http.Response\nand error instances to its caller.\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateless Policy:\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateful Policy:\n\nThe Transporter interface is responsible for sending the HTTP request and returning the corresponding\nHTTP response or error.  The Transporter is invoked by the last Policy in the chain.  The default Transporter\nimplementation uses a shared http.Client from the standard library.\n\nThe same stateful/stateless rules for Policy implementations apply to Transporter implementations.\n\nTo use the Policy and Transporter instances, an application passes them to the runtime.NewPipeline function.\n\nThe specified Policy instances form a chain and are invoked in the order provided to NewPipeline\nfollowed by the Transporter.\n\nOnce the Pipeline has been created, create a runtime.Request instance and pass it to Pipeline's Do method.\n\nThe Pipeline.Do method sends the specified Request through the chain of Policy and Transporter\ninstances.  The response/error is then sent through the same chain of Policy instances in reverse\norder.  For example, assuming there are Policy types PolicyA, PolicyB, and PolicyC along with\nTransportA.\n\nThe flow of Request and Response looks like the following:\n\nThe Request instance passed to Pipeline's Do method is a wrapper around an *http.Request.  It also\ncontains some internal state and provides various convenience methods.  You create a Request instance\nby calling the runtime.NewRequest function:\n\nIf the Request should contain a body, call the SetBody method.\n\nA seekable stream is required so that upon retry, the retry Policy instance can seek the stream\nback to the beginning before retrying the network request and re-uploading the body.\n\nOperations like JSON-MERGE-PATCH send a JSON null to indicate a value should be deleted.\n\nThis requirement conflicts with the SDK's default marshalling that specifies \"omitempty\" as\na means to resolve the ambiguity between a field to be excluded and its zero-value.\n\nIn the above example, Name and Count are defined as pointer-to-type to disambiguate between\na missing value (nil) and a zero-value (0) which might have semantic differences.\n\nIn a PATCH operation, any fields left as nil are to have their values preserved.  When updating\na Widget's count, one simply specifies the new value for Count, leaving Name nil.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement for sending a JSON null, the NullValue() function can be used.\n\nThis sends an explict \"null\" for Count, indicating that any current value for Count should be deleted.\n\nWhen the HTTP response is received, the *http.Response is returned directly. Each Policy instance\ncan inspect/mutate the *http.Response.\n\nTo enable logging, set environment variable AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING to \"all\" before executing your program.\n\nBy default the logger writes to stderr.  This can be customized by calling log.SetListener, providing\na callback that writes to the desired location.  Any custom logging implementation MUST provide its\nown synchronization to handle concurrent invocations.\n\nSee the docs for the log package for further details.\n\nPageable operations return potentially large data sets spread over multiple GET requests.  The result of\neach GET is a \"page\" of data consisting of a slice of items.\n\nPageable operations can be identified by their New*Pager naming convention and return type of *runtime.Pager[T].\n\nThe call to WidgetClient.NewListWidgetsPager() returns an instance of *runtime.Pager[T] for fetching pages\nand determining if there are more pages to fetch.  No IO calls are made until the NextPage() method is invoked.\n\nLong-running operations (LROs) are operations consisting of an initial request to start the operation followed\nby polling to determine when the operation has reached a terminal state.  An LRO's terminal state is one\nof the following values.\n\nLROs can be identified by their Begin* prefix and their return type of *runtime.Poller[T].\n\nWhen a call to WidgetClient.BeginCreateOrUpdate() returns a nil error, it means that the LRO has started.\nIt does _not_ mean that the widget has been created or updated (or failed to be created/updated).\n\nThe *runtime.Poller[T] provides APIs for determining the state of the LRO.  To wait for the LRO to complete,\ncall the PollUntilDone() method.\n\nThe call to PollUntilDone() will block the current goroutine until the LRO has reached a terminal state or the\ncontext is canceled/timed out.\n\nNote that LROs can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  The duration is operation-dependent.  Due to\nthis variant behavior, pollers do _not_ have a preconfigured time-out.  Use a context with the appropriate cancellation\nmechanism as required.\n\nPollers provide the ability to serialize their state into a \"resume token\" which can be used by another process to\nrecreate the poller.  This is achieved via the runtime.Poller[T].ResumeToken() method.\n\nNote that a token can only be obtained for a poller that's in a non-terminal state.  Also note that any subsequent calls\nto poller.Poll() might change the poller's state.  In this case, a new token should be created.\n\nAfter the token has been obtained, it can be used to recreate an instance of the originating poller.\n\nWhen resuming a poller, no IO is performed, and zero-value arguments can be used for everything but the Options.ResumeToken.\n\nResume tokens are unique per service client and operation.  Attempting to resume a poller for LRO BeginB() with a token from LRO\nBeginA() will result in an error.\n\nThe fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.\nThis allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.\n\nPlease see https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/samples/fakes for details and examples on how to use fakes.",

      "version": "v1.17.0",
      "description": "Package azcore implements an HTTP request/response middleware pipeline used by Azure SDK clients.\n\nThe middleware consists of three components.\n\nA Policy can be implemented in two ways; as a first-class function for a stateless Policy, or as\na method on a type for a stateful Policy.  Note that HTTP requests made via the same pipeline share\nthe same Policy instances, so if a Policy mutates its state it MUST be properly synchronized to\navoid race conditions.\n\nA Policy's Do method is called when an HTTP request wants to be sent over the network. The Do method can\nperform any operation(s) it desires. For example, it can log the outgoing request, mutate the URL, headers,\nand/or query parameters, inject a failure, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its request\nwork, it must call the Next() method on the *policy.Request instance in order to pass the request to the\nnext Policy in the chain.\n\nWhen an HTTP response comes back, the Policy then gets a chance to process the response/error.  The Policy instance\ncan log the response, retry the operation if it failed due to a transient error or timeout, unmarshal the response\nbody, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its response work, it must return the *http.Response\nand error instances to its caller.\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateless Policy:\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateful Policy:\n\nThe Transporter interface is responsible for sending the HTTP request and returning the corresponding\nHTTP response or error.  The Transporter is invoked by the last Policy in the chain.  The default Transporter\nimplementation uses a shared http.Client from the standard library.\n\nThe same stateful/stateless rules for Policy implementations apply to Transporter implementations.\n\nTo use the Policy and Transporter instances, an application passes them to the runtime.NewPipeline function.\n\nThe specified Policy instances form a chain and are invoked in the order provided to NewPipeline\nfollowed by the Transporter.\n\nOnce the Pipeline has been created, create a runtime.Request instance and pass it to Pipeline's Do method.\n\nThe Pipeline.Do method sends the specified Request through the chain of Policy and Transporter\ninstances.  The response/error is then sent through the same chain of Policy instances in reverse\norder.  For example, assuming there are Policy types PolicyA, PolicyB, and PolicyC along with\nTransportA.\n\nThe flow of Request and Response looks like the following:\n\nThe Request instance passed to Pipeline's Do method is a wrapper around an *http.Request.  It also\ncontains some internal state and provides various convenience methods.  You create a Request instance\nby calling the runtime.NewRequest function:\n\nIf the Request should contain a body, call the SetBody method.\n\nA seekable stream is required so that upon retry, the retry Policy instance can seek the stream\nback to the beginning before retrying the network request and re-uploading the body.\n\nOperations like JSON-MERGE-PATCH send a JSON null to indicate a value should be deleted.\n\nThis requirement conflicts with the SDK's default marshalling that specifies \"omitempty\" as\na means to resolve the ambiguity between a field to be excluded and its zero-value.\n\nIn the above example, Name and Count are defined as pointer-to-type to disambiguate between\na missing value (nil) and a zero-value (0) which might have semantic differences.\n\nIn a PATCH operation, any fields left as nil are to have their values preserved.  When updating\na Widget's count, one simply specifies the new value for Count, leaving Name nil.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement for sending a JSON null, the NullValue() function can be used.\n\nThis sends an explict \"null\" for Count, indicating that any current value for Count should be deleted.\n\nWhen the HTTP response is received, the *http.Response is returned directly. Each Policy instance\ncan inspect/mutate the *http.Response.\n\nTo enable logging, set environment variable AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING to \"all\" before executing your program.\n\nBy default the logger writes to stderr.  This can be customized by calling log.SetListener, providing\na callback that writes to the desired location.  Any custom logging implementation MUST provide its\nown synchronization to handle concurrent invocations.\n\nSee the docs for the log package for further details.\n\nPageable operations return potentially large data sets spread over multiple GET requests.  The result of\neach GET is a \"page\" of data consisting of a slice of items.\n\nPageable operations can be identified by their New*Pager naming convention and return type of *runtime.Pager[T].\n\nThe call to WidgetClient.NewListWidgetsPager() returns an instance of *runtime.Pager[T] for fetching pages\nand determining if there are more pages to fetch.  No IO calls are made until the NextPage() method is invoked.\n\nLong-running operations (LROs) are operations consisting of an initial request to start the operation followed\nby polling to determine when the operation has reached a terminal state.  An LRO's terminal state is one\nof the following values.\n\nLROs can be identified by their Begin* prefix and their return type of *runtime.Poller[T].\n\nWhen a call to WidgetClient.BeginCreateOrUpdate() returns a nil error, it means that the LRO has started.\nIt does _not_ mean that the widget has been created or updated (or failed to be created/updated).\n\nThe *runtime.Poller[T] provides APIs for determining the state of the LRO.  To wait for the LRO to complete,\ncall the PollUntilDone() method.\n\nThe call to PollUntilDone() will block the current goroutine until the LRO has reached a terminal state or the\ncontext is canceled/timed out.\n\nNote that LROs can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  The duration is operation-dependent.  Due to\nthis variant behavior, pollers do _not_ have a preconfigured time-out.  Use a context with the appropriate cancellation\nmechanism as required.\n\nPollers provide the ability to serialize their state into a \"resume token\" which can be used by another process to\nrecreate the poller.  This is achieved via the runtime.Poller[T].ResumeToken() method.\n\nNote that a token can only be obtained for a poller that's in a non-terminal state.  Also note that any subsequent calls\nto poller.Poll() might change the poller's state.  In this case, a new token should be created.\n\nAfter the token has been obtained, it can be used to recreate an instance of the originating poller.\n\nWhen resuming a poller, no IO is performed, and zero-value arguments can be used for everything but the Options.ResumeToken.\n\nResume tokens are unique per service client and operation.  Attempting to resume a poller for LRO BeginB() with a token from LRO\nBeginA() will result in an error.\n\nThe fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.\nThis allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.\n\nPlease see https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/samples/fakes for details and examples on how to use fakes.",

      "description": "Package flags provides an extensive command line option parser.\nThe flags package is similar in functionality to the go built-in flag package\nbut provides more options and uses reflection to provide a convenient and\nsuccinct way of specifying command line options.\n\nThe following features are supported in go-flags:\n\nAdditional features specific to Windows:\n\nThe flags package uses structs, reflection and struct field tags\nto allow users to specify command line options. This results in very simple\nand concise specification of your application options. For example:\n\nThis specifies one option with a short name -v and a long name --verbose.\nWhen either -v or --verbose is found on the command line, a 'true' value\nwill be appended to the Verbose field. e.g. when specifying -vvv, the\nresulting value of Verbose will be {[true, true, true]}.\n\nSlice options work exactly the same as primitive type options, except that\nwhenever the option is encountered, a value is appended to the slice.\n\nMap options from string to primitive type are also supported. On the command\nline, you specify the value for such an option as key:value. For example\n\nThen, the AuthorInfo map can be filled with something like\n-a name:Jesse -a \"surname:van den Kieboom\".\n\nFinally, for full control over the conversion between command line argument\nvalues and options, user defined types can choose to implement the Marshaler\nand Unmarshaler interfaces.\n\nThe following is a list of tags for struct fields supported by go-flags:\n\nEither the `short:` tag or the `long:` must be specified to make the field eligible as an\noption.\n\nOption groups are a simple way to semantically separate your options. All\noptions in a particular group are shown together in the help under the name\nof the group. Namespaces can be used to specify option long names more\nprecisely and emphasize the options affiliation to their group.\n\nThere are currently three ways to specify option groups.\n\nThe flags package also has basic support for commands. Commands are often\nused in monolithic applications that support various commands or actions.\nTake git for example, all of the add, commit, checkout, etc. are called\ncommands. Using commands you can easily separate multiple functions of your\napplication.\n\nThere are currently two ways to specify a command.\n\nThe most common, idiomatic way to implement commands is to define a global\nparser instance and implement each command in a separate file. These\ncommand files should define a go init function which calls AddCommand on\nthe global parser.\n\nWhen parsing ends and there is an active command and that command implements\nthe Commander interface, then its Execute method will be run with the\nremaining command line arguments.\n\nCommand structs can have options which become valid to parse after the\ncommand has been specified on the command line, in addition to the options\nof all the parent commands. I.e. considering a -v flag on the parser and an\nadd command, the following are equivalent:\n\nHowever, if the -v flag is defined on the add command, then the first of\nthe two examples above would fail since the -v flag is not defined before\nthe add command.\n\ngo-flags has builtin support to provide bash completion of flags, commands\nand argument values. To use completion, the binary which uses go-flags\ncan be invoked in a special environment to list completion of the current\ncommand line argument. It should be noted that this `executes` your application,\nand it is up to the user to make sure there are no negative side effects (for\nexample from init functions).\n\nSetting the environment variable `GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION=1` enables completion\nby replacing the argument parsing routine with the completion routine which\noutputs completions for the passed arguments. The basic invocation to\ncomplete a set of arguments is therefore:\n\nwhere `completion-example` is the binary, `arg1` and `arg2` are\nthe current arguments, and `arg3` (the last argument) is the argument\nto be completed. If the GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set to \"verbose\", then\ndescriptions of possible completion items will also be shown, if there\nare more than 1 completion items.\n\nTo use this with bash completion, a simple file can be written which\ncalls the binary which supports go-flags completion:\n\nCompletion requires the parser option PassDoubleDash and is therefore enforced if the environment variable GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set.\n\nCustomized completion for argument values is supported by implementing\nthe flags.Completer interface for the argument value type. An example\nof a type which does so is the flags.Filename type, an alias of string\nallowing simple filename completion. A slice or array argument value\nwhose element type implements flags.Completer will also be completed.",

      "version": "v1.17.0",
      "description": "Package azcore implements an HTTP request/response middleware pipeline used by Azure SDK clients.\n\nThe middleware consists of three components.\n\nA Policy can be implemented in two ways; as a first-class function for a stateless Policy, or as\na method on a type for a stateful Policy.  Note that HTTP requests made via the same pipeline share\nthe same Policy instances, so if a Policy mutates its state it MUST be properly synchronized to\navoid race conditions.\n\nA Policy's Do method is called when an HTTP request wants to be sent over the network. The Do method can\nperform any operation(s) it desires. For example, it can log the outgoing request, mutate the URL, headers,\nand/or query parameters, inject a failure, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its request\nwork, it must call the Next() method on the *policy.Request instance in order to pass the request to the\nnext Policy in the chain.\n\nWhen an HTTP response comes back, the Policy then gets a chance to process the response/error.  The Policy instance\ncan log the response, retry the operation if it failed due to a transient error or timeout, unmarshal the response\nbody, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its response work, it must return the *http.Response\nand error instances to its caller.\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateless Policy:\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateful Policy:\n\nThe Transporter interface is responsible for sending the HTTP request and returning the corresponding\nHTTP response or error.  The Transporter is invoked by the last Policy in the chain.  The default Transporter\nimplementation uses a shared http.Client from the standard library.\n\nThe same stateful/stateless rules for Policy implementations apply to Transporter implementations.\n\nTo use the Policy and Transporter instances, an application passes them to the runtime.NewPipeline function.\n\nThe specified Policy instances form a chain and are invoked in the order provided to NewPipeline\nfollowed by the Transporter.\n\nOnce the Pipeline has been created, create a runtime.Request instance and pass it to Pipeline's Do method.\n\nThe Pipeline.Do method sends the specified Request through the chain of Policy and Transporter\ninstances.  The response/error is then sent through the same chain of Policy instances in reverse\norder.  For example, assuming there are Policy types PolicyA, PolicyB, and PolicyC along with\nTransportA.\n\nThe flow of Request and Response looks like the following:\n\nThe Request instance passed to Pipeline's Do method is a wrapper around an *http.Request.  It also\ncontains some internal state and provides various convenience methods.  You create a Request instance\nby calling the runtime.NewRequest function:\n\nIf the Request should contain a body, call the SetBody method.\n\nA seekable stream is required so that upon retry, the retry Policy instance can seek the stream\nback to the beginning before retrying the network request and re-uploading the body.\n\nOperations like JSON-MERGE-PATCH send a JSON null to indicate a value should be deleted.\n\nThis requirement conflicts with the SDK's default marshalling that specifies \"omitempty\" as\na means to resolve the ambiguity between a field to be excluded and its zero-value.\n\nIn the above example, Name and Count are defined as pointer-to-type to disambiguate between\na missing value (nil) and a zero-value (0) which might have semantic differences.\n\nIn a PATCH operation, any fields left as nil are to have their values preserved.  When updating\na Widget's count, one simply specifies the new value for Count, leaving Name nil.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement for sending a JSON null, the NullValue() function can be used.\n\nThis sends an explict \"null\" for Count, indicating that any current value for Count should be deleted.\n\nWhen the HTTP response is received, the *http.Response is returned directly. Each Policy instance\ncan inspect/mutate the *http.Response.\n\nTo enable logging, set environment variable AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING to \"all\" before executing your program.\n\nBy default the logger writes to stderr.  This can be customized by calling log.SetListener, providing\na callback that writes to the desired location.  Any custom logging implementation MUST provide its\nown synchronization to handle concurrent invocations.\n\nSee the docs for the log package for further details.\n\nPageable operations return potentially large data sets spread over multiple GET requests.  The result of\neach GET is a \"page\" of data consisting of a slice of items.\n\nPageable operations can be identified by their New*Pager naming convention and return type of *runtime.Pager[T].\n\nThe call to WidgetClient.NewListWidgetsPager() returns an instance of *runtime.Pager[T] for fetching pages\nand determining if there are more pages to fetch.  No IO calls are made until the NextPage() method is invoked.\n\nLong-running operations (LROs) are operations consisting of an initial request to start the operation followed\nby polling to determine when the operation has reached a terminal state.  An LRO's terminal state is one\nof the following values.\n\nLROs can be identified by their Begin* prefix and their return type of *runtime.Poller[T].\n\nWhen a call to WidgetClient.BeginCreateOrUpdate() returns a nil error, it means that the LRO has started.\nIt does _not_ mean that the widget has been created or updated (or failed to be created/updated).\n\nThe *runtime.Poller[T] provides APIs for determining the state of the LRO.  To wait for the LRO to complete,\ncall the PollUntilDone() method.\n\nThe call to PollUntilDone() will block the current goroutine until the LRO has reached a terminal state or the\ncontext is canceled/timed out.\n\nNote that LROs can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  The duration is operation-dependent.  Due to\nthis variant behavior, pollers do _not_ have a preconfigured time-out.  Use a context with the appropriate cancellation\nmechanism as required.\n\nPollers provide the ability to serialize their state into a \"resume token\" which can be used by another process to\nrecreate the poller.  This is achieved via the runtime.Poller[T].ResumeToken() method.\n\nNote that a token can only be obtained for a poller that's in a non-terminal state.  Also note that any subsequent calls\nto poller.Poll() might change the poller's state.  In this case, a new token should be created.\n\nAfter the token has been obtained, it can be used to recreate an instance of the originating poller.\n\nWhen resuming a poller, no IO is performed, and zero-value arguments can be used for everything but the Options.ResumeToken.\n\nResume tokens are unique per service client and operation.  Attempting to resume a poller for LRO BeginB() with a token from LRO\nBeginA() will result in an error.\n\nThe fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.\nThis allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.\n\nPlease see https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/samples/fakes for details and examples on how to use fakes.",

      "description": "Package flags provides an extensive command line option parser.\nThe flags package is similar in functionality to the go built-in flag package\nbut provides more options and uses reflection to provide a convenient and\nsuccinct way of specifying command line options.\n\nThe following features are supported in go-flags:\n\nAdditional features specific to Windows:\n\nThe flags package uses structs, reflection and struct field tags\nto allow users to specify command line options. This results in very simple\nand concise specification of your application options. For example:\n\nThis specifies one option with a short name -v and a long name --verbose.\nWhen either -v or --verbose is found on the command line, a 'true' value\nwill be appended to the Verbose field. e.g. when specifying -vvv, the\nresulting value of Verbose will be {[true, true, true]}.\n\nSlice options work exactly the same as primitive type options, except that\nwhenever the option is encountered, a value is appended to the slice.\n\nMap options from string to primitive type are also supported. On the command\nline, you specify the value for such an option as key:value. For example\n\nThen, the AuthorInfo map can be filled with something like\n-a name:Jesse -a \"surname:van den Kieboom\".\n\nFinally, for full control over the conversion between command line argument\nvalues and options, user defined types can choose to implement the Marshaler\nand Unmarshaler interfaces.\n\nThe following is a list of tags for struct fields supported by go-flags:\n\nEither the `short:` tag or the `long:` must be specified to make the field eligible as an\noption.\n\nOption groups are a simple way to semantically separate your options. All\noptions in a particular group are shown together in the help under the name\nof the group. Namespaces can be used to specify option long names more\nprecisely and emphasize the options affiliation to their group.\n\nThere are currently three ways to specify option groups.\n\nThe flags package also has basic support for commands. Commands are often\nused in monolithic applications that support various commands or actions.\nTake git for example, all of the add, commit, checkout, etc. are called\ncommands. Using commands you can easily separate multiple functions of your\napplication.\n\nThere are currently two ways to specify a command.\n\nThe most common, idiomatic way to implement commands is to define a global\nparser instance and implement each command in a separate file. These\ncommand files should define a go init function which calls AddCommand on\nthe global parser.\n\nWhen parsing ends and there is an active command and that command implements\nthe Commander interface, then its Execute method will be run with the\nremaining command line arguments.\n\nCommand structs can have options which become valid to parse after the\ncommand has been specified on the command line, in addition to the options\nof all the parent commands. I.e. considering a -v flag on the parser and an\nadd command, the following are equivalent:\n\nHowever, if the -v flag is defined on the add command, then the first of\nthe two examples above would fail since the -v flag is not defined before\nthe add command.\n\ngo-flags has builtin support to provide bash completion of flags, commands\nand argument values. To use completion, the binary which uses go-flags\ncan be invoked in a special environment to list completion of the current\ncommand line argument. It should be noted that this `executes` your application,\nand it is up to the user to make sure there are no negative side effects (for\nexample from init functions).\n\nSetting the environment variable `GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION=1` enables completion\nby replacing the argument parsing routine with the completion routine which\noutputs completions for the passed arguments. The basic invocation to\ncomplete a set of arguments is therefore:\n\nwhere `completion-example` is the binary, `arg1` and `arg2` are\nthe current arguments, and `arg3` (the last argument) is the argument\nto be completed. If the GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set to \"verbose\", then\ndescriptions of possible completion items will also be shown, if there\nare more than 1 completion items.\n\nTo use this with bash completion, a simple file can be written which\ncalls the binary which supports go-flags completion:\n\nCompletion requires the parser option PassDoubleDash and is therefore enforced if the environment variable GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set.\n\nCustomized completion for argument values is supported by implementing\nthe flags.Completer interface for the argument value type. An example\nof a type which does so is the flags.Filename type, an alias of string\nallowing simple filename completion. A slice or array argument value\nwhose element type implements flags.Completer will also be completed.",

      "description": "Package azcore implements an HTTP request/response middleware pipeline used by Azure SDK clients.\n\nThe middleware consists of three components.\n\nA Policy can be implemented in two ways; as a first-class function for a stateless Policy, or as\na method on a type for a stateful Policy.  Note that HTTP requests made via the same pipeline share\nthe same Policy instances, so if a Policy mutates its state it MUST be properly synchronized to\navoid race conditions.\n\nA Policy's Do method is called when an HTTP request wants to be sent over the network. The Do method can\nperform any operation(s) it desires. For example, it can log the outgoing request, mutate the URL, headers,\nand/or query parameters, inject a failure, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its request\nwork, it must call the Next() method on the *policy.Request instance in order to pass the request to the\nnext Policy in the chain.\n\nWhen an HTTP response comes back, the Policy then gets a chance to process the response/error.  The Policy instance\ncan log the response, retry the operation if it failed due to a transient error or timeout, unmarshal the response\nbody, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its response work, it must return the *http.Response\nand error instances to its caller.\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateless Policy:\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateful Policy:\n\nThe Transporter interface is responsible for sending the HTTP request and returning the corresponding\nHTTP response or error.  The Transporter is invoked by the last Policy in the chain.  The default Transporter\nimplementation uses a shared http.Client from the standard library.\n\nThe same stateful/stateless rules for Policy implementations apply to Transporter implementations.\n\nTo use the Policy and Transporter instances, an application passes them to the runtime.NewPipeline function.\n\nThe specified Policy instances form a chain and are invoked in the order provided to NewPipeline\nfollowed by the Transporter.\n\nOnce the Pipeline has been created, create a runtime.Request instance and pass it to Pipeline's Do method.\n\nThe Pipeline.Do method sends the specified Request through the chain of Policy and Transporter\ninstances.  The response/error is then sent through the same chain of Policy instances in reverse\norder.  For example, assuming there are Policy types PolicyA, PolicyB, and PolicyC along with\nTransportA.\n\nThe flow of Request and Response looks like the following:\n\nThe Request instance passed to Pipeline's Do method is a wrapper around an *http.Request.  It also\ncontains some internal state and provides various convenience methods.  You create a Request instance\nby calling the runtime.NewRequest function:\n\nIf the Request should contain a body, call the SetBody method.\n\nA seekable stream is required so that upon retry, the retry Policy instance can seek the stream\nback to the beginning before retrying the network request and re-uploading the body.\n\nOperations like JSON-MERGE-PATCH send a JSON null to indicate a value should be deleted.\n\nThis requirement conflicts with the SDK's default marshalling that specifies \"omitempty\" as\na means to resolve the ambiguity between a field to be excluded and its zero-value.\n\nIn the above example, Name and Count are defined as pointer-to-type to disambiguate between\na missing value (nil) and a zero-value (0) which might have semantic differences.\n\nIn a PATCH operation, any fields left as nil are to have their values preserved.  When updating\na Widget's count, one simply specifies the new value for Count, leaving Name nil.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement for sending a JSON null, the NullValue() function can be used.\n\nThis sends an explict \"null\" for Count, indicating that any current value for Count should be deleted.\n\nWhen the HTTP response is received, the *http.Response is returned directly. Each Policy instance\ncan inspect/mutate the *http.Response.\n\nTo enable logging, set environment variable AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING to \"all\" before executing your program.\n\nBy default the logger writes to stderr.  This can be customized by calling log.SetListener, providing\na callback that writes to the desired location.  Any custom logging implementation MUST provide its\nown synchronization to handle concurrent invocations.\n\nSee the docs for the log package for further details.\n\nPageable operations return potentially large data sets spread over multiple GET requests.  The result of\neach GET is a \"page\" of data consisting of a slice of items.\n\nPageable operations can be identified by their New*Pager naming convention and return type of *runtime.Pager[T].\n\nThe call to WidgetClient.NewListWidgetsPager() returns an instance of *runtime.Pager[T] for fetching pages\nand determining if there are more pages to fetch.  No IO calls are made until the NextPage() method is invoked.\n\nLong-running operations (LROs) are operations consisting of an initial request to start the operation followed\nby polling to determine when the operation has reached a terminal state.  An LRO's terminal state is one\nof the following values.\n\nLROs can be identified by their Begin* prefix and their return type of *runtime.Poller[T].\n\nWhen a call to WidgetClient.BeginCreateOrUpdate() returns a nil error, it means that the LRO has started.\nIt does _not_ mean that the widget has been created or updated (or failed to be created/updated).\n\nThe *runtime.Poller[T] provides APIs for determining the state of the LRO.  To wait for the LRO to complete,\ncall the PollUntilDone() method.\n\nThe call to PollUntilDone() will block the current goroutine until the LRO has reached a terminal state or the\ncontext is canceled/timed out.\n\nNote that LROs can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  The duration is operation-dependent.  Due to\nthis variant behavior, pollers do _not_ have a preconfigured time-out.  Use a context with the appropriate cancellation\nmechanism as required.\n\nPollers provide the ability to serialize their state into a \"resume token\" which can be used by another process to\nrecreate the poller.  This is achieved via the runtime.Poller[T].ResumeToken() method.\n\nNote that a token can only be obtained for a poller that's in a non-terminal state.  Also note that any subsequent calls\nto poller.Poll() might change the poller's state.  In this case, a new token should be created.\n\nAfter the token has been obtained, it can be used to recreate an instance of the originating poller.\n\nWhen resuming a poller, no IO is performed, and zero-value arguments can be used for everything but the Options.ResumeToken.\n\nResume tokens are unique per service client and operation.  Attempting to resume a poller for LRO BeginB() with a token from LRO\nBeginA() will result in an error.\n\nThe fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.\nThis allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.\n\nPlease see https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/samples/fakes for details and examples on how to use fakes.",

The final dead state is only reached\nonce all tracked goroutines terminate, at which point calling\nthe Go method again will cause a runtime panic.\n\nTracked functions and methods that are still running while the tomb\nis in dying state may choose to return ErrDying as their error value.\nThis preserves the well established non-nil error convention, but is\nunderstood by the tomb as a clean termination.

      "description": "Package flags provides an extensive command line option parser.\nThe flags package is similar in functionality to the go built-in flag package\nbut provides more options and uses reflection to provide a convenient and\nsuccinct way of specifying command line options.\n\nThe following features are supported in go-flags:\n\nAdditional features specific to Windows:\n\nThe flags package uses structs, reflection and struct field tags\nto allow users to specify command line options. This results in very simple\nand concise specification of your application options. For example:\n\nThis specifies one option with a short name -v and a long name --verbose.\nWhen either -v or --verbose is found on the command line, a 'true' value\nwill be appended to the Verbose field. e.g. when specifying -vvv, the\nresulting value of Verbose will be {[true, true, true]}.\n\nSlice options work exactly the same as primitive type options, except that\nwhenever the option is encountered, a value is appended to the slice.\n\nMap options from string to primitive type are also supported. On the command\nline, you specify the value for such an option as key:value. For example\n\nThen, the AuthorInfo map can be filled with something like\n-a name:Jesse -a \"surname:van den Kieboom\".\n\nFinally, for full control over the conversion between command line argument\nvalues and options, user defined types can choose to implement the Marshaler\nand Unmarshaler interfaces.\n\nThe following is a list of tags for struct fields supported by go-flags:\n\nEither the `short:` tag or the `long:` must be specified to make the field eligible as an\noption.\n\nOption groups are a simple way to semantically separate your options. All\noptions in a particular group are shown together in the help under the name\nof the group. Namespaces can be used to specify option long names more\nprecisely and emphasize the options affiliation to their group.\n\nThere are currently three ways to specify option groups.\n\nThe flags package also has basic support for commands. Commands are often\nused in monolithic applications that support various commands or actions.\nTake git for example, all of the add, commit, checkout, etc. are called\ncommands. Using commands you can easily separate multiple functions of your\napplication.\n\nThere are currently two ways to specify a command.\n\nThe most common, idiomatic way to implement commands is to define a global\nparser instance and implement each command in a separate file. These\ncommand files should define a go init function which calls AddCommand on\nthe global parser.\n\nWhen parsing ends and there is an active command and that command implements\nthe Commander interface, then its Execute method will be run with the\nremaining command line arguments.\n\nCommand structs can have options which become valid to parse after the\ncommand has been specified on the command line, in addition to the options\nof all the parent commands. I.e. considering a -v flag on the parser and an\nadd command, the following are equivalent:\n\nHowever, if the -v flag is defined on the add command, then the first of\nthe two examples above would fail since the -v flag is not defined before\nthe add command.\n\ngo-flags has builtin support to provide bash completion of flags, commands\nand argument values. To use completion, the binary which uses go-flags\ncan be invoked in a special environment to list completion of the current\ncommand line argument. It should be noted that this `executes` your application,\nand it is up to the user to make sure there are no negative side effects (for\nexample from init functions).\n\nSetting the environment variable `GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION=1` enables completion\nby replacing the argument parsing routine with the completion routine which\noutputs completions for the passed arguments. The basic invocation to\ncomplete a set of arguments is therefore:\n\nwhere `completion-example` is the binary, `arg1` and `arg2` are\nthe current arguments, and `arg3` (the last argument) is the argument\nto be completed. If the GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set to \"verbose\", then\ndescriptions of possible completion items will also be shown, if there\nare more than 1 completion items.\n\nTo use this with bash completion, a simple file can be written which\ncalls the binary which supports go-flags completion:\n\nCompletion requires the parser option PassDoubleDash and is therefore enforced if the environment variable GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set.\n\nCustomized completion for argument values is supported by implementing\nthe flags.Completer interface for the argument value type. An example\nof a type which does so is the flags.Filename type, an alias of string\nallowing simple filename completion. A slice or array argument value\nwhose element type implements flags.Completer will also be completed.",

      "description": "Package errors provides simple error handling primitives.\n\nThe traditional error handling idiom in Go is roughly akin to\n\nwhich when applied recursively up the call stack results in error reports\nwithout context or debugging information. The errors package allows\nprogrammers to add context to the failure path in their code in a way\nthat does not destroy the original value of the error.\n\nThe errors.Wrap function returns a new error that adds context to the\noriginal error by recording a stack trace at the point Wrap is called,\ntogether with the supplied message. For example\n\nIf additional control is required, the errors.WithStack and\nerrors.WithMessage functions destructure errors.Wrap into its component\noperations: annotating an error with a stack trace and with a message,\nrespectively.\n\nUsing errors.Wrap constructs a stack of errors, adding context to the\npreceding error. Depending on the nature of the error it may be necessary\nto reverse the operation of errors.Wrap to retrieve the original error\nfor inspection. Any error value which implements this interface\n\ncan be inspected by errors.Cause. errors.Cause will recursively retrieve\nthe topmost error that does not implement causer, which is assumed to be\nthe original cause. For example:\n\nAlthough the causer interface is not exported by this package, it is\nconsidered a part of its stable public interface.\n\nAll error values returned from this package implement fmt.Formatter and can\nbe formatted by the fmt package. The following verbs are supported:\n\nNew, Errorf, Wrap, and Wrapf record a stack trace at the point they are\ninvoked. This information can be retrieved with the following interface:\n\nThe returned errors.StackTrace type is defined as\n\nThe Frame type represents a call site in the stack trace. Frame supports\nthe fmt.Formatter interface that can be used for printing information about\nthe stack trace of this error. For example:\n\nAlthough the stackTracer interface is not exported by this package, it is\nconsidered a part of its stable public interface.\n\nSee the documentation for Frame.Format for more details.",

      "description": "Package azcore implements an HTTP request/response middleware pipeline used by Azure SDK clients.\n\nThe middleware consists of three components.\n\nA Policy can be implemented in two ways; as a first-class function for a stateless Policy, or as\na method on a type for a stateful Policy.  Note that HTTP requests made via the same pipeline share\nthe same Policy instances, so if a Policy mutates its state it MUST be properly synchronized to\navoid race conditions.\n\nA Policy's Do method is called when an HTTP request wants to be sent over the network. The Do method can\nperform any operation(s) it desires. For example, it can log the outgoing request, mutate the URL, headers,\nand/or query parameters, inject a failure, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its request\nwork, it must call the Next() method on the *policy.Request instance in order to pass the request to the\nnext Policy in the chain.\n\nWhen an HTTP response comes back, the Policy then gets a chance to process the response/error.  The Policy instance\ncan log the response, retry the operation if it failed due to a transient error or timeout, unmarshal the response\nbody, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its response work, it must return the *http.Response\nand error instances to its caller.\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateless Policy:\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateful Policy:\n\nThe Transporter interface is responsible for sending the HTTP request and returning the corresponding\nHTTP response or error.  The Transporter is invoked by the last Policy in the chain.  The default Transporter\nimplementation uses a shared http.Client from the standard library.\n\nThe same stateful/stateless rules for Policy implementations apply to Transporter implementations.\n\nTo use the Policy and Transporter instances, an application passes them to the runtime.NewPipeline function.\n\nThe specified Policy instances form a chain and are invoked in the order provided to NewPipeline\nfollowed by the Transporter.\n\nOnce the Pipeline has been created, create a runtime.Request instance and pass it to Pipeline's Do method.\n\nThe Pipeline.Do method sends the specified Request through the chain of Policy and Transporter\ninstances.  The response/error is then sent through the same chain of Policy instances in reverse\norder.  For example, assuming there are Policy types PolicyA, PolicyB, and PolicyC along with\nTransportA.\n\nThe flow of Request and Response looks like the following:\n\nThe Request instance passed to Pipeline's Do method is a wrapper around an *http.Request.  It also\ncontains some internal state and provides various convenience methods.  You create a Request instance\nby calling the runtime.NewRequest function:\n\nIf the Request should contain a body, call the SetBody method.\n\nA seekable stream is required so that upon retry, the retry Policy instance can seek the stream\nback to the beginning before retrying the network request and re-uploading the body.\n\nOperations like JSON-MERGE-PATCH send a JSON null to indicate a value should be deleted.\n\nThis requirement conflicts with the SDK's default marshalling that specifies \"omitempty\" as\na means to resolve the ambiguity between a field to be excluded and its zero-value.\n\nIn the above example, Name and Count are defined as pointer-to-type to disambiguate between\na missing value (nil) and a zero-value (0) which might have semantic differences.\n\nIn a PATCH operation, any fields left as nil are to have their values preserved.  When updating\na Widget's count, one simply specifies the new value for Count, leaving Name nil.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement for sending a JSON null, the NullValue() function can be used.\n\nThis sends an explict \"null\" for Count, indicating that any current value for Count should be deleted.\n\nWhen the HTTP response is received, the *http.Response is returned directly. Each Policy instance\ncan inspect/mutate the *http.Response.\n\nTo enable logging, set environment variable AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING to \"all\" before executing your program.\n\nBy default the logger writes to stderr.  This can be customized by calling log.SetListener, providing\na callback that writes to the desired location.  Any custom logging implementation MUST provide its\nown synchronization to handle concurrent invocations.\n\nSee the docs for the log package for further details.\n\nPageable operations return potentially large data sets spread over multiple GET requests.  The result of\neach GET is a \"page\" of data consisting of a slice of items.\n\nPageable operations can be identified by their New*Pager naming convention and return type of *runtime.Pager[T].\n\nThe call to WidgetClient.NewListWidgetsPager() returns an instance of *runtime.Pager[T] for fetching pages\nand determining if there are more pages to fetch.  No IO calls are made until the NextPage() method is invoked.\n\nLong-running operations (LROs) are operations consisting of an initial request to start the operation followed\nby polling to determine when the operation has reached a terminal state.  An LRO's terminal state is one\nof the following values.\n\nLROs can be identified by their Begin* prefix and their return type of *runtime.Poller[T].\n\nWhen a call to WidgetClient.BeginCreateOrUpdate() returns a nil error, it means that the LRO has started.\nIt does _not_ mean that the widget has been created or updated (or failed to be created/updated).\n\nThe *runtime.Poller[T] provides APIs for determining the state of the LRO.  To wait for the LRO to complete,\ncall the PollUntilDone() method.\n\nThe call to PollUntilDone() will block the current goroutine until the LRO has reached a terminal state or the\ncontext is canceled/timed out.\n\nNote that LROs can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  The duration is operation-dependent.  Due to\nthis variant behavior, pollers do _not_ have a preconfigured time-out.  Use a context with the appropriate cancellation\nmechanism as required.\n\nPollers provide the ability to serialize their state into a \"resume token\" which can be used by another process to\nrecreate the poller.  This is achieved via the runtime.Poller[T].ResumeToken() method.\n\nNote that a token can only be obtained for a poller that's in a non-terminal state.  Also note that any subsequent calls\nto poller.Poll() might change the poller's state.  In this case, a new token should be created.\n\nAfter the token has been obtained, it can be used to recreate an instance of the originating poller.\n\nWhen resuming a poller, no IO is performed, and zero-value arguments can be used for everything but the Options.ResumeToken.\n\nResume tokens are unique per service client and operation.  Attempting to resume a poller for LRO BeginB() with a token from LRO\nBeginA() will result in an error.\n\nThe fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.\nThis allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.\n\nPlease see https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/samples/fakes for details and examples on how to use fakes.",

      "description": "Package flags provides an extensive command line option parser.\nThe flags package is similar in functionality to the go built-in flag package\nbut provides more options and uses reflection to provide a convenient and\nsuccinct way of specifying command line options.\n\nThe following features are supported in go-flags:\n\nAdditional features specific to Windows:\n\nThe flags package uses structs, reflection and struct field tags\nto allow users to specify command line options. This results in very simple\nand concise specification of your application options. For example:\n\nThis specifies one option with a short name -v and a long name --verbose.\nWhen either -v or --verbose is found on the command line, a 'true' value\nwill be appended to the Verbose field. e.g. when specifying -vvv, the\nresulting value of Verbose will be {[true, true, true]}.\n\nSlice options work exactly the same as primitive type options, except that\nwhenever the option is encountered, a value is appended to the slice.\n\nMap options from string to primitive type are also supported. On the command\nline, you specify the value for such an option as key:value. For example\n\nThen, the AuthorInfo map can be filled with something like\n-a name:Jesse -a \"surname:van den Kieboom\".\n\nFinally, for full control over the conversion between command line argument\nvalues and options, user defined types can choose to implement the Marshaler\nand Unmarshaler interfaces.\n\nThe following is a list of tags for struct fields supported by go-flags:\n\nEither the `short:` tag or the `long:` must be specified to make the field eligible as an\noption.\n\nOption groups are a simple way to semantically separate your options. All\noptions in a particular group are shown together in the help under the name\nof the group. Namespaces can be used to specify option long names more\nprecisely and emphasize the options affiliation to their group.\n\nThere are currently three ways to specify option groups.\n\nThe flags package also has basic support for commands. Commands are often\nused in monolithic applications that support various commands or actions.\nTake git for example, all of the add, commit, checkout, etc. are called\ncommands. Using commands you can easily separate multiple functions of your\napplication.\n\nThere are currently two ways to specify a command.\n\nThe most common, idiomatic way to implement commands is to define a global\nparser instance and implement each command in a separate file. These\ncommand files should define a go init function which calls AddCommand on\nthe global parser.\n\nWhen parsing ends and there is an active command and that command implements\nthe Commander interface, then its Execute method will be run with the\nremaining command line arguments.\n\nCommand structs can have options which become valid to parse after the\ncommand has been specified on the command line, in addition to the options\nof all the parent commands. I.e. considering a -v flag on the parser and an\nadd command, the following are equivalent:\n\nHowever, if the -v flag is defined on the add command, then the first of\nthe two examples above would fail since the -v flag is not defined before\nthe add command.\n\ngo-flags has builtin support to provide bash completion of flags, commands\nand argument values. To use completion, the binary which uses go-flags\ncan be invoked in a special environment to list completion of the current\ncommand line argument. It should be noted that this `executes` your application,\nand it is up to the user to make sure there are no negative side effects (for\nexample from init functions).\n\nSetting the environment variable `GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION=1` enables completion\nby replacing the argument parsing routine with the completion routine which\noutputs completions for the passed arguments. The basic invocation to\ncomplete a set of arguments is therefore:\n\nwhere `completion-example` is the binary, `arg1` and `arg2` are\nthe current arguments, and `arg3` (the last argument) is the argument\nto be completed. If the GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set to \"verbose\", then\ndescriptions of possible completion items will also be shown, if there\nare more than 1 completion items.\n\nTo use this with bash completion, a simple file can be written which\ncalls the binary which supports go-flags completion:\n\nCompletion requires the parser option PassDoubleDash and is therefore enforced if the environment variable GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set.\n\nCustomized completion for argument values is supported by implementing\nthe flags.Completer interface for the argument value type. An example\nof a type which does so is the flags.Filename type, an alias of string\nallowing simple filename completion. A slice or array argument value\nwhose element type implements flags.Completer will also be completed.",

The errors package allows\nprogrammers to add context to the failure path in their code in a way\nthat does not destroy the original value of the error.\n\nThe errors.Wrap function returns a new error that adds context to the\noriginal error by recording a stack trace at the point Wrap is called,\ntogether with the supplied message. For example\n\nIf additional control is required, the errors.WithStack and\nerrors.WithMessage functions destructure errors.Wrap into its component\noperations: annotating an error with a stack trace and with a message,\nrespectively.\n\nUsing errors.Wrap constructs a stack of errors, adding context to the\npreceding error. Depending on the nature of the error it may be necessary\nto reverse the operation of errors.Wrap to retrieve the original error\nfor inspection. Any error value which implements this interface\n\ncan be inspected by errors.Cause. errors.Cause will recursively retrieve\nthe topmost error that does not implement causer, which is assumed to be\nthe original cause. For example:\n\nAlthough the causer interface is not exported by this package, it is\nconsidered a part of its stable public interface.\n\nAll error values returned from this package implement fmt.Formatter and can\nbe formatted by the fmt package. The following verbs are supported:\n\nNew, Errorf, Wrap, and Wrapf record a stack trace at the point they are\ninvoked. This information can be retrieved with the following interface:\n\nThe returned errors.StackTrace type is defined as\n\nThe Frame type represents a call site in the stack trace. Frame supports\nthe fmt.Formatter interface that can be used for printing information about\nthe stack trace of this error. For example:\n\nAlthough the stackTracer interface is not exported by this package, it is\nconsidered a part of its stable public interface.\n\nSee the documentation for Frame.Format for more details.",

The errors package allows\nprogrammers to add context to the failure path in their code in a way\nthat does not destroy the original value of the error.\n\nThe errors.Wrap function returns a new error that adds context to the\noriginal error by recording a stack trace at the point Wrap is called,\ntogether with the supplied message. For example\n\nIf additional control is required, the errors.WithStack and\nerrors.WithMessage functions destructure errors.Wrap into its component\noperations: annotating an error with a stack trace and with a message,\nrespectively.\n\nUsing errors.Wrap constructs a stack of errors, adding context to the\npreceding error. Depending on the nature of the error it may be necessary\nto reverse the operation of errors.Wrap to retrieve the original error\nfor inspection. Any error value which implements this interface\n\ncan be inspected by errors.Cause. errors.Cause will recursively retrieve\nthe topmost error that does not implement causer, which is assumed to be\nthe original cause. For example:\n\nAlthough the causer interface is not exported by this package, it is\nconsidered a part of its stable public interface.\n\nAll error values returned from this package implement fmt.Formatter and can\nbe formatted by the fmt package. The following verbs are supported:\n\nNew, Errorf, Wrap, and Wrapf record a stack trace at the point they are\ninvoked. This information can be retrieved with the following interface:\n\nThe returned errors.StackTrace type is defined as\n\nThe Frame type represents a call site in the stack trace. Frame supports\nthe fmt.Formatter interface that can be used for printing information about\nthe stack trace of this error.

      "version": "v1.17.0",
      "description": "Package azcore implements an HTTP request/response middleware pipeline used by Azure SDK clients.\n\nThe middleware consists of three components.\n\nA Policy can be implemented in two ways; as a first-class function for a stateless Policy, or as\na method on a type for a stateful Policy.  Note that HTTP requests made via the same pipeline share\nthe same Policy instances, so if a Policy mutates its state it MUST be properly synchronized to\navoid race conditions.\n\nA Policy's Do method is called when an HTTP request wants to be sent over the network. The Do method can\nperform any operation(s) it desires. For example, it can log the outgoing request, mutate the URL, headers,\nand/or query parameters, inject a failure, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its request\nwork, it must call the Next() method on the *policy.Request instance in order to pass the request to the\nnext Policy in the chain.\n\nWhen an HTTP response comes back, the Policy then gets a chance to process the response/error.  The Policy instance\ncan log the response, retry the operation if it failed due to a transient error or timeout, unmarshal the response\nbody, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its response work, it must return the *http.Response\nand error instances to its caller.\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateless Policy:\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateful Policy:\n\nThe Transporter interface is responsible for sending the HTTP request and returning the corresponding\nHTTP response or error.  The Transporter is invoked by the last Policy in the chain.  The default Transporter\nimplementation uses a shared http.Client from the standard library.\n\nThe same stateful/stateless rules for Policy implementations apply to Transporter implementations.\n\nTo use the Policy and Transporter instances, an application passes them to the runtime.NewPipeline function.\n\nThe specified Policy instances form a chain and are invoked in the order provided to NewPipeline\nfollowed by the Transporter.\n\nOnce the Pipeline has been created, create a runtime.Request instance and pass it to Pipeline's Do method.\n\nThe Pipeline.Do method sends the specified Request through the chain of Policy and Transporter\ninstances.  The response/error is then sent through the same chain of Policy instances in reverse\norder.  For example, assuming there are Policy types PolicyA, PolicyB, and PolicyC along with\nTransportA.\n\nThe flow of Request and Response looks like the following:\n\nThe Request instance passed to Pipeline's Do method is a wrapper around an *http.Request.  It also\ncontains some internal state and provides various convenience methods.  You create a Request instance\nby calling the runtime.NewRequest function:\n\nIf the Request should contain a body, call the SetBody method.\n\nA seekable stream is required so that upon retry, the retry Policy instance can seek the stream\nback to the beginning before retrying the network request and re-uploading the body.\n\nOperations like JSON-MERGE-PATCH send a JSON null to indicate a value should be deleted.\n\nThis requirement conflicts with the SDK's default marshalling that specifies \"omitempty\" as\na means to resolve the ambiguity between a field to be excluded and its zero-value.\n\nIn the above example, Name and Count are defined as pointer-to-type to disambiguate between\na missing value (nil) and a zero-value (0) which might have semantic differences.\n\nIn a PATCH operation, any fields left as nil are to have their values preserved.  When updating\na Widget's count, one simply specifies the new value for Count, leaving Name nil.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement for sending a JSON null, the NullValue() function can be used.\n\nThis sends an explict \"null\" for Count, indicating that any current value for Count should be deleted.\n\nWhen the HTTP response is received, the *http.Response is returned directly. Each Policy instance\ncan inspect/mutate the *http.Response.\n\nTo enable logging, set environment variable AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING to \"all\" before executing your program.\n\nBy default the logger writes to stderr.  This can be customized by calling log.SetListener, providing\na callback that writes to the desired location.  Any custom logging implementation MUST provide its\nown synchronization to handle concurrent invocations.\n\nSee the docs for the log package for further details.\n\nPageable operations return potentially large data sets spread over multiple GET requests.  The result of\neach GET is a \"page\" of data consisting of a slice of items.\n\nPageable operations can be identified by their New*Pager naming convention and return type of *runtime.Pager[T].\n\nThe call to WidgetClient.NewListWidgetsPager() returns an instance of *runtime.Pager[T] for fetching pages\nand determining if there are more pages to fetch.  No IO calls are made until the NextPage() method is invoked.\n\nLong-running operations (LROs) are operations consisting of an initial request to start the operation followed\nby polling to determine when the operation has reached a terminal state.  An LRO's terminal state is one\nof the following values.\n\nLROs can be identified by their Begin* prefix and their return type of *runtime.Poller[T].\n\nWhen a call to WidgetClient.BeginCreateOrUpdate() returns a nil error, it means that the LRO has started.\nIt does _not_ mean that the widget has been created or updated (or failed to be created/updated).\n\nThe *runtime.Poller[T] provides APIs for determining the state of the LRO.  To wait for the LRO to complete,\ncall the PollUntilDone() method.\n\nThe call to PollUntilDone() will block the current goroutine until the LRO has reached a terminal state or the\ncontext is canceled/timed out.\n\nNote that LROs can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  The duration is operation-dependent.  Due to\nthis variant behavior, pollers do _not_ have a preconfigured time-out.  Use a context with the appropriate cancellation\nmechanism as required.\n\nPollers provide the ability to serialize their state into a \"resume token\" which can be used by another process to\nrecreate the poller.  This is achieved via the runtime.Poller[T].ResumeToken() method.\n\nNote that a token can only be obtained for a poller that's in a non-terminal state.  Also note that any subsequent calls\nto poller.Poll() might change the poller's state.  In this case, a new token should be created.\n\nAfter the token has been obtained, it can be used to recreate an instance of the originating poller.\n\nWhen resuming a poller, no IO is performed, and zero-value arguments can be used for everything but the Options.ResumeToken.\n\nResume tokens are unique per service client and operation.  Attempting to resume a poller for LRO BeginB() with a token from LRO\nBeginA() will result in an error.\n\nThe fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.\nThis allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.\n\nPlease see https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/samples/fakes for details and examples on how to use fakes.",

      "description": "Package flags provides an extensive command line option parser.\nThe flags package is similar in functionality to the go built-in flag package\nbut provides more options and uses reflection to provide a convenient and\nsuccinct way of specifying command line options.\n\nThe following features are supported in go-flags:\n\nAdditional features specific to Windows:\n\nThe flags package uses structs, reflection and struct field tags\nto allow users to specify command line options. This results in very simple\nand concise specification of your application options. For example:\n\nThis specifies one option with a short name -v and a long name --verbose.\nWhen either -v or --verbose is found on the command line, a 'true' value\nwill be appended to the Verbose field. e.g. when specifying -vvv, the\nresulting value of Verbose will be {[true, true, true]}.\n\nSlice options work exactly the same as primitive type options, except that\nwhenever the option is encountered, a value is appended to the slice.\n\nMap options from string to primitive type are also supported. On the command\nline, you specify the value for such an option as key:value. For example\n\nThen, the AuthorInfo map can be filled with something like\n-a name:Jesse -a \"surname:van den Kieboom\".\n\nFinally, for full control over the conversion between command line argument\nvalues and options, user defined types can choose to implement the Marshaler\nand Unmarshaler interfaces.\n\nThe following is a list of tags for struct fields supported by go-flags:\n\nEither the `short:` tag or the `long:` must be specified to make the field eligible as an\noption.\n\nOption groups are a simple way to semantically separate your options. All\noptions in a particular group are shown together in the help under the name\nof the group. Namespaces can be used to specify option long names more\nprecisely and emphasize the options affiliation to their group.\n\nThere are currently three ways to specify option groups.\n\nThe flags package also has basic support for commands. Commands are often\nused in monolithic applications that support various commands or actions.\nTake git for example, all of the add, commit, checkout, etc. are called\ncommands. Using commands you can easily separate multiple functions of your\napplication.\n\nThere are currently two ways to specify a command.\n\nThe most common, idiomatic way to implement commands is to define a global\nparser instance and implement each command in a separate file. These\ncommand files should define a go init function which calls AddCommand on\nthe global parser.\n\nWhen parsing ends and there is an active command and that command implements\nthe Commander interface, then its Execute method will be run with the\nremaining command line arguments.\n\nCommand structs can have options which become valid to parse after the\ncommand has been specified on the command line, in addition to the options\nof all the parent commands. I.e. considering a -v flag on the parser and an\nadd command, the following are equivalent:\n\nHowever, if the -v flag is defined on the add command, then the first of\nthe two examples above would fail since the -v flag is not defined before\nthe add command.\n\ngo-flags has builtin support to provide bash completion of flags, commands\nand argument values. To use completion, the binary which uses go-flags\ncan be invoked in a special environment to list completion of the current\ncommand line argument. It should be noted that this `executes` your application,\nand it is up to the user to make sure there are no negative side effects (for\nexample from init functions).\n\nSetting the environment variable `GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION=1` enables completion\nby replacing the argument parsing routine with the completion routine which\noutputs completions for the passed arguments. The basic invocation to\ncomplete a set of arguments is therefore:\n\nwhere `completion-example` is the binary, `arg1` and `arg2` are\nthe current arguments, and `arg3` (the last argument) is the argument\nto be completed. If the GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set to \"verbose\", then\ndescriptions of possible completion items will also be shown, if there\nare more than 1 completion items.\n\nTo use this with bash completion, a simple file can be written which\ncalls the binary which supports go-flags completion:\n\nCompletion requires the parser option PassDoubleDash and is therefore enforced if the environment variable GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set.\n\nCustomized completion for argument values is supported by implementing\nthe flags.Completer interface for the argument value type. An example\nof a type which does so is the flags.Filename type, an alias of string\nallowing simple filename completion. A slice or array argument value\nwhose element type implements flags.Completer will also be completed.",

      "description": "Package flags provides an extensive command line option parser.\nThe flags package is similar in functionality to the go built-in flag package\nbut provides more options and uses reflection to provide a convenient and\nsuccinct way of specifying command line options.\n\nThe following features are supported in go-flags:\n\nAdditional features specific to Windows:\n\nThe flags package uses structs, reflection and struct field tags\nto allow users to specify command line options. This results in very simple\nand concise specification of your application options. For example:\n\nThis specifies one option with a short name -v and a long name --verbose.\nWhen either -v or --verbose is found on the command line, a 'true' value\nwill be appended to the Verbose field. e.g. when specifying -vvv, the\nresulting value of Verbose will be {[true, true, true]}.\n\nSlice options work exactly the same as primitive type options, except that\nwhenever the option is encountered, a value is appended to the slice.\n\nMap options from string to primitive type are also supported. On the command\nline, you specify the value for such an option as key:value. For example\n\nThen, the AuthorInfo map can be filled with something like\n-a name:Jesse -a \"surname:van den Kieboom\".\n\nFinally, for full control over the conversion between command line argument\nvalues and options, user defined types can choose to implement the Marshaler\nand Unmarshaler interfaces.\n\nThe following is a list of tags for struct fields supported by go-flags:\n\nEither the `short:` tag or the `long:` must be specified to make the field eligible as an\noption.\n\nOption groups are a simple way to semantically separate your options. All\noptions in a particular group are shown together in the help under the name\nof the group. Namespaces can be used to specify option long names more\nprecisely and emphasize the options affiliation to their group.\n\nThere are currently three ways to specify option groups.\n\nThe flags package also has basic support for commands. Commands are often\nused in monolithic applications that support various commands or actions.\nTake git for example, all of the add, commit, checkout, etc. are called\ncommands. Using commands you can easily separate multiple functions of your\napplication.\n\nThere are currently two ways to specify a command.\n\nThe most common, idiomatic way to implement commands is to define a global\nparser instance and implement each command in a separate file. These\ncommand files should define a go init function which calls AddCommand on\nthe global parser.\n\nWhen parsing ends and there is an active command and that command implements\nthe Commander interface, then its Execute method will be run with the\nremaining command line arguments.\n\nCommand structs can have options which become valid to parse after the\ncommand has been specified on the command line, in addition to the options\nof all the parent commands. I.e. considering a -v flag on the parser and an\nadd command, the following are equivalent:\n\nHowever, if the -v flag is defined on the add command, then the first of\nthe two examples above would fail since the -v flag is not defined before\nthe add command.\n\ngo-flags has builtin support to provide bash completion of flags, commands\nand argument values. To use completion, the binary which uses go-flags\ncan be invoked in a special environment to list completion of the current\ncommand line argument. It should be noted that this `executes` your application,\nand it is up to the user to make sure there are no negative side effects (for\nexample from init functions).\n\nSetting the environment variable `GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION=1` enables completion\nby replacing the argument parsing routine with the completion routine which\noutputs completions for the passed arguments. The basic invocation to\ncomplete a set of arguments is therefore:\n\nwhere `completion-example` is the binary, `arg1` and `arg2` are\nthe current arguments, and `arg3` (the last argument) is the argument\nto be completed. If the GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set to \"verbose\", then\ndescriptions of possible completion items will also be shown, if there\nare more than 1 completion items.\n\nTo use this with bash completion, a simple file can be written which\ncalls the binary which supports go-flags completion:\n\nCompletion requires the parser option PassDoubleDash and is therefore enforced if the environment variable GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set.\n\nCustomized completion for argument values is supported by implementing\nthe flags.Completer interface for the argument value type. An example\nof a type which does so is the flags.Filename type, an alias of string\nallowing simple filename completion. A slice or array argument value\nwhose element type implements flags.Completer will also be completed.",

      "description": "Package flags provides an extensive command line option parser.\nThe flags package is similar in functionality to the go built-in flag package\nbut provides more options and uses reflection to provide a convenient and\nsuccinct way of specifying command line options.\n\nThe following features are supported in go-flags:\n\nAdditional features specific to Windows:\n\nThe flags package uses structs, reflection and struct field tags\nto allow users to specify command line options. This results in very simple\nand concise specification of your application options. For example:\n\nThis specifies one option with a short name -v and a long name --verbose.\nWhen either -v or --verbose is found on the command line, a 'true' value\nwill be appended to the Verbose field. e.g. when specifying -vvv, the\nresulting value of Verbose will be {[true, true, true]}.\n\nSlice options work exactly the same as primitive type options, except that\nwhenever the option is encountered, a value is appended to the slice.\n\nMap options from string to primitive type are also supported. On the command\nline, you specify the value for such an option as key:value. For example\n\nThen, the AuthorInfo map can be filled with something like\n-a name:Jesse -a \"surname:van den Kieboom\".\n\nFinally, for full control over the conversion between command line argument\nvalues and options, user defined types can choose to implement the Marshaler\nand Unmarshaler interfaces.\n\nThe following is a list of tags for struct fields supported by go-flags:\n\nEither the `short:` tag or the `long:` must be specified to make the field eligible as an\noption.\n\nOption groups are a simple way to semantically separate your options. All\noptions in a particular group are shown together in the help under the name\nof the group. Namespaces can be used to specify option long names more\nprecisely and emphasize the options affiliation to their group.\n\nThere are currently three ways to specify option groups.\n\nThe flags package also has basic support for commands. Commands are often\nused in monolithic applications that support various commands or actions.\nTake git for example, all of the add, commit, checkout, etc. are called\ncommands. Using commands you can easily separate multiple functions of your\napplication.\n\nThere are currently two ways to specify a command.\n\nThe most common, idiomatic way to implement commands is to define a global\nparser instance and implement each command in a separate file. These\ncommand files should define a go init function which calls AddCommand on\nthe global parser.\n\nWhen parsing ends and there is an active command and that command implements\nthe Commander interface, then its Execute method will be run with the\nremaining command line arguments.\n\nCommand structs can have options which become valid to parse after the\ncommand has been specified on the command line, in addition to the options\nof all the parent commands. I.e. considering a -v flag on the parser and an\nadd command, the following are equivalent:\n\nHowever, if the -v flag is defined on the add command, then the first of\nthe two examples above would fail since the -v flag is not defined before\nthe add command.\n\ngo-flags has builtin support to provide bash completion of flags, commands\nand argument values. To use completion, the binary which uses go-flags\ncan be invoked in a special environment to list completion of the current\ncommand line argument. It should be noted that this `executes` your application,\nand it is up to the user to make sure there are no negative side effects (for\nexample from init functions).\n\nSetting the environment variable `GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION=1` enables completion\nby replacing the argument parsing routine with the completion routine which\noutputs completions for the passed arguments. The basic invocation to\ncomplete a set of arguments is therefore:\n\nwhere `completion-example` is the binary, `arg1` and `arg2` are\nthe current arguments, and `arg3` (the last argument) is the argument\nto be completed. If the GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set to \"verbose\", then\ndescriptions of possible completion items will also be shown, if there\nare more than 1 completion items.\n\nTo use this with bash completion, a simple file can be written which\ncalls the binary which supports go-flags completion:\n\nCompletion requires the parser option PassDoubleDash and is therefore enforced if the environment variable GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set.\n\nCustomized completion for argument values is supported by implementing\nthe flags.Completer interface for the argument value type. An example\nof a type which does so is the flags.Filename type, an alias of string\nallowing simple filename completion. A slice or array argument value\nwhose element type implements flags.Completer will also be completed.",

Channel binding\ncryptographically binds the SCRAM authentication to an underlying TLS\nconnection, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nTo use channel binding, create conversations with channel binding data\nobtained from the TLS connection:\n\nHelper functions are provided to create ChannelBinding values from TLS connections:\n\nChannel binding is configured on conversations rather than clients or servers\nbecause binding data is connection-specific.\n\nChannel binding type negotiation is not defined by the SCRAM protocol.\nApplications must ensure both client and server agree on the same channel binding\ntype.\n\n\nExampleClient_channelBindingModes demonstrates the three channel binding modes\navailable when creating authentication conversations.",

      "description": "The tomb package handles clean goroutine tracking and termination.\n\nThe zero value of a Tomb is ready to handle the creation of a tracked\ngoroutine via its Go method, and then any tracked goroutine may call\nthe Go method again to create additional tracked goroutines at\nany point.\n\nIf any of the tracked goroutines returns a non-nil error, or the\nKill or Killf method is called by any goroutine in the system (tracked\nor not), the tomb Err is set, Alive is set to false, and the Dying\nchannel is closed to flag that all tracked goroutines are supposed\nto willingly terminate as soon as possible.\n\nOnce all tracked goroutines terminate, the Dead channel is closed,\nand Wait unblocks and returns the first non-nil error presented\nto the tomb via a result or an explicit Kill or Killf method call,\nor nil if there were no errors.\n\nIt is okay to create further goroutines via the Go method while\nthe tomb is in a dying state. The final dead state is only reached\nonce all tracked goroutines terminate, at which point calling\nthe Go method again will cause a runtime panic.\n\nTracked functions and methods that are still running while the tomb\nis in dying state may choose to return ErrDying as their error value.\nThis preserves the well established non-nil error convention, but is\nunderstood by the tomb as a clean termination. The Err and Wait\nmethods will still return nil if all observed errors were either\nnil or ErrDying.\n\nFor background and a detailed example, see the following blog post:",

      "description": "Package flags provides an extensive command line option parser.\nThe flags package is similar in functionality to the go built-in flag package\nbut provides more options and uses reflection to provide a convenient and\nsuccinct way of specifying command line options.\n\nThe following features are supported in go-flags:\n\nAdditional features specific to Windows:\n\nThe flags package uses structs, reflection and struct field tags\nto allow users to specify command line options. This results in very simple\nand concise specification of your application options. For example:\n\nThis specifies one option with a short name -v and a long name --verbose.\nWhen either -v or --verbose is found on the command line, a 'true' value\nwill be appended to the Verbose field. e.g. when specifying -vvv, the\nresulting value of Verbose will be {[true, true, true]}.\n\nSlice options work exactly the same as primitive type options, except that\nwhenever the option is encountered, a value is appended to the slice.\n\nMap options from string to primitive type are also supported. On the command\nline, you specify the value for such an option as key:value. For example\n\nThen, the AuthorInfo map can be filled with something like\n-a name:Jesse -a \"surname:van den Kieboom\".\n\nFinally, for full control over the conversion between command line argument\nvalues and options, user defined types can choose to implement the Marshaler\nand Unmarshaler interfaces.\n\nThe following is a list of tags for struct fields supported by go-flags:\n\nEither the `short:` tag or the `long:` must be specified to make the field eligible as an\noption.\n\nOption groups are a simple way to semantically separate your options. All\noptions in a particular group are shown together in the help under the name\nof the group. Namespaces can be used to specify option long names more\nprecisely and emphasize the options affiliation to their group.\n\nThere are currently three ways to specify option groups.\n\nThe flags package also has basic support for commands. Commands are often\nused in monolithic applications that support various commands or actions.\nTake git for example, all of the add, commit, checkout, etc. are called\ncommands. Using commands you can easily separate multiple functions of your\napplication.\n\nThere are currently two ways to specify a command.\n\nThe most common, idiomatic way to implement commands is to define a global\nparser instance and implement each command in a separate file. These\ncommand files should define a go init function which calls AddCommand on\nthe global parser.\n\nWhen parsing ends and there is an active command and that command implements\nthe Commander interface, then its Execute method will be run with the\nremaining command line arguments.\n\nCommand structs can have options which become valid to parse after the\ncommand has been specified on the command line, in addition to the options\nof all the parent commands. I.e. considering a -v flag on the parser and an\nadd command, the following are equivalent:\n\nHowever, if the -v flag is defined on the add command, then the first of\nthe two examples above would fail since the -v flag is not defined before\nthe add command.\n\ngo-flags has builtin support to provide bash completion of flags, commands\nand argument values. To use completion, the binary which uses go-flags\ncan be invoked in a special environment to list completion of the current\ncommand line argument. It should be noted that this `executes` your application,\nand it is up to the user to make sure there are no negative side effects (for\nexample from init functions).\n\nSetting the environment variable `GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION=1` enables completion\nby replacing the argument parsing routine with the completion routine which\noutputs completions for the passed arguments. The basic invocation to\ncomplete a set of arguments is therefore:\n\nwhere `completion-example` is the binary, `arg1` and `arg2` are\nthe current arguments, and `arg3` (the last argument) is the argument\nto be completed. If the GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set to \"verbose\", then\ndescriptions of possible completion items will also be shown, if there\nare more than 1 completion items.\n\nTo use this with bash completion, a simple file can be written which\ncalls the binary which supports go-flags completion:\n\nCompletion requires the parser option PassDoubleDash and is therefore enforced if the environment variable GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set.\n\nCustomized completion for argument values is supported by implementing\nthe flags.Completer interface for the argument value type. An example\nof a type which does so is the flags.Filename type, an alias of string\nallowing simple filename completion. A slice or array argument value\nwhose element type implements flags.Completer will also be completed.",

      "description": "Package flags provides an extensive command line option parser.\nThe flags package is similar in functionality to the go built-in flag package\nbut provides more options and uses reflection to provide a convenient and\nsuccinct way of specifying command line options.\n\nThe following features are supported in go-flags:\n\nAdditional features specific to Windows:\n\nThe flags package uses structs, reflection and struct field tags\nto allow users to specify command line options. This results in very simple\nand concise specification of your application options. For example:\n\nThis specifies one option with a short name -v and a long name --verbose.\nWhen either -v or --verbose is found on the command line, a 'true' value\nwill be appended to the Verbose field. e.g. when specifying -vvv, the\nresulting value of Verbose will be {[true, true, true]}.\n\nSlice options work exactly the same as primitive type options, except that\nwhenever the option is encountered, a value is appended to the slice.\n\nMap options from string to primitive type are also supported. On the command\nline, you specify the value for such an option as key:value. For example\n\nThen, the AuthorInfo map can be filled with something like\n-a name:Jesse -a \"surname:van den Kieboom\".\n\nFinally, for full control over the conversion between command line argument\nvalues and options, user defined types can choose to implement the Marshaler\nand Unmarshaler interfaces.\n\nThe following is a list of tags for struct fields supported by go-flags:\n\nEither the `short:` tag or the `long:` must be specified to make the field eligible as an\noption.\n\nOption groups are a simple way to semantically separate your options. All\noptions in a particular group are shown together in the help under the name\nof the group. Namespaces can be used to specify option long names more\nprecisely and emphasize the options affiliation to their group.\n\nThere are currently three ways to specify option groups.\n\nThe flags package also has basic support for commands. Commands are often\nused in monolithic applications that support various commands or actions.\nTake git for example, all of the add, commit, checkout, etc. are called\ncommands. Using commands you can easily separate multiple functions of your\napplication.\n\nThere are currently two ways to specify a command.\n\nThe most common, idiomatic way to implement commands is to define a global\nparser instance and implement each command in a separate file. These\ncommand files should define a go init function which calls AddCommand on\nthe global parser.\n\nWhen parsing ends and there is an active command and that command implements\nthe Commander interface, then its Execute method will be run with the\nremaining command line arguments.\n\nCommand structs can have options which become valid to parse after the\ncommand has been specified on the command line, in addition to the options\nof all the parent commands. I.e. considering a -v flag on the parser and an\nadd command, the following are equivalent:\n\nHowever, if the -v flag is defined on the add command, then the first of\nthe two examples above would fail since the -v flag is not defined before\nthe add command.\n\ngo-flags has builtin support to provide bash completion of flags, commands\nand argument values. To use completion, the binary which uses go-flags\ncan be invoked in a special environment to list completion of the current\ncommand line argument. It should be noted that this `executes` your application,\nand it is up to the user to make sure there are no negative side effects (for\nexample from init functions).\n\nSetting the environment variable `GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION=1` enables completion\nby replacing the argument parsing routine with the completion routine which\noutputs completions for the passed arguments. The basic invocation to\ncomplete a set of arguments is therefore:\n\nwhere `completion-example` is the binary, `arg1` and `arg2` are\nthe current arguments, and `arg3` (the last argument) is the argument\nto be completed. If the GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set to \"verbose\", then\ndescriptions of possible completion items will also be shown, if there\nare more than 1 completion items.\n\nTo use this with bash completion, a simple file can be written which\ncalls the binary which supports go-flags completion:\n\nCompletion requires the parser option PassDoubleDash and is therefore enforced if the environment variable GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set.\n\nCustomized completion for argument values is supported by implementing\nthe flags.Completer interface for the argument value type. An example\nof a type which does so is the flags.Filename type, an alias of string\nallowing simple filename completion. A slice or array argument value\nwhose element type implements flags.Completer will also be completed.",

The errors package allows\nprogrammers to add context to the failure path in their code in a way\nthat does not destroy the original value of the error.\n\nThe errors.Wrap function returns a new error that adds context to the\noriginal error by recording a stack trace at the point Wrap is called,\ntogether with the supplied message. For example\n\nIf additional control is required, the errors.WithStack and\nerrors.WithMessage functions destructure errors.Wrap into its component\noperations: annotating an error with a stack trace and with a message,\nrespectively.\n\nUsing errors.Wrap constructs a stack of errors, adding context to the\npreceding error. Depending on the nature of the error it may be necessary\nto reverse the operation of errors.Wrap to retrieve the original error\nfor inspection. Any error value which implements this interface\n\ncan be inspected by errors.Cause. errors.Cause will recursively retrieve\nthe topmost error that does not implement causer, which is assumed to be\nthe original cause. For example:\n\nAlthough the causer interface is not exported by this package, it is\nconsidered a part of its stable public interface.\n\nAll error values returned from this package implement fmt.Formatter and can\nbe formatted by the fmt package. The following verbs are supported:\n\nNew, Errorf, Wrap, and Wrapf record a stack trace at the point they are\ninvoked. This information can be retrieved with the following interface:\n\nThe returned errors.StackTrace type is defined as\n\nThe Frame type represents a call site in the stack trace.

      "description": "Package flags provides an extensive command line option parser.\nThe flags package is similar in functionality to the go built-in flag package\nbut provides more options and uses reflection to provide a convenient and\nsuccinct way of specifying command line options.\n\nThe following features are supported in go-flags:\n\nAdditional features specific to Windows:\n\nThe flags package uses structs, reflection and struct field tags\nto allow users to specify command line options. This results in very simple\nand concise specification of your application options. For example:\n\nThis specifies one option with a short name -v and a long name --verbose.\nWhen either -v or --verbose is found on the command line, a 'true' value\nwill be appended to the Verbose field. e.g. when specifying -vvv, the\nresulting value of Verbose will be {[true, true, true]}.\n\nSlice options work exactly the same as primitive type options, except that\nwhenever the option is encountered, a value is appended to the slice.\n\nMap options from string to primitive type are also supported. On the command\nline, you specify the value for such an option as key:value. For example\n\nThen, the AuthorInfo map can be filled with something like\n-a name:Jesse -a \"surname:van den Kieboom\".\n\nFinally, for full control over the conversion between command line argument\nvalues and options, user defined types can choose to implement the Marshaler\nand Unmarshaler interfaces.\n\nThe following is a list of tags for struct fields supported by go-flags:\n\nEither the `short:` tag or the `long:` must be specified to make the field eligible as an\noption.\n\nOption groups are a simple way to semantically separate your options. All\noptions in a particular group are shown together in the help under the name\nof the group. Namespaces can be used to specify option long names more\nprecisely and emphasize the options affiliation to their group.\n\nThere are currently three ways to specify option groups.\n\nThe flags package also has basic support for commands. Commands are often\nused in monolithic applications that support various commands or actions.\nTake git for example, all of the add, commit, checkout, etc. are called\ncommands. Using commands you can easily separate multiple functions of your\napplication.\n\nThere are currently two ways to specify a command.\n\nThe most common, idiomatic way to implement commands is to define a global\nparser instance and implement each command in a separate file. These\ncommand files should define a go init function which calls AddCommand on\nthe global parser.\n\nWhen parsing ends and there is an active command and that command implements\nthe Commander interface, then its Execute method will be run with the\nremaining command line arguments.\n\nCommand structs can have options which become valid to parse after the\ncommand has been specified on the command line, in addition to the options\nof all the parent commands. I.e. considering a -v flag on the parser and an\nadd command, the following are equivalent:\n\nHowever, if the -v flag is defined on the add command, then the first of\nthe two examples above would fail since the -v flag is not defined before\nthe add command.\n\ngo-flags has builtin support to provide bash completion of flags, commands\nand argument values. To use completion, the binary which uses go-flags\ncan be invoked in a special environment to list completion of the current\ncommand line argument. It should be noted that this `executes` your application,\nand it is up to the user to make sure there are no negative side effects (for\nexample from init functions).\n\nSetting the environment variable `GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION=1` enables completion\nby replacing the argument parsing routine with the completion routine which\noutputs completions for the passed arguments. The basic invocation to\ncomplete a set of arguments is therefore:\n\nwhere `completion-example` is the binary, `arg1` and `arg2` are\nthe current arguments, and `arg3` (the last argument) is the argument\nto be completed. If the GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set to \"verbose\", then\ndescriptions of possible completion items will also be shown, if there\nare more than 1 completion items.\n\nTo use this with bash completion, a simple file can be written which\ncalls the binary which supports go-flags completion:\n\nCompletion requires the parser option PassDoubleDash and is therefore enforced if the environment variable GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set.\n\nCustomized completion for argument values is supported by implementing\nthe flags.Completer interface for the argument value type. An example\nof a type which does so is the flags.Filename type, an alias of string\nallowing simple filename completion. A slice or array argument value\nwhose element type implements flags.Completer will also be completed.",

      "description": "Package azcore implements an HTTP request/response middleware pipeline used by Azure SDK clients.\n\nThe middleware consists of three components.\n\nA Policy can be implemented in two ways; as a first-class function for a stateless Policy, or as\na method on a type for a stateful Policy.  Note that HTTP requests made via the same pipeline share\nthe same Policy instances, so if a Policy mutates its state it MUST be properly synchronized to\navoid race conditions.\n\nA Policy's Do method is called when an HTTP request wants to be sent over the network. The Do method can\nperform any operation(s) it desires. For example, it can log the outgoing request, mutate the URL, headers,\nand/or query parameters, inject a failure, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its request\nwork, it must call the Next() method on the *policy.Request instance in order to pass the request to the\nnext Policy in the chain.\n\nWhen an HTTP response comes back, the Policy then gets a chance to process the response/error.  The Policy instance\ncan log the response, retry the operation if it failed due to a transient error or timeout, unmarshal the response\nbody, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its response work, it must return the *http.Response\nand error instances to its caller.\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateless Policy:\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateful Policy:\n\nThe Transporter interface is responsible for sending the HTTP request and returning the corresponding\nHTTP response or error.  The Transporter is invoked by the last Policy in the chain.  The default Transporter\nimplementation uses a shared http.Client from the standard library.\n\nThe same stateful/stateless rules for Policy implementations apply to Transporter implementations.\n\nTo use the Policy and Transporter instances, an application passes them to the runtime.NewPipeline function.\n\nThe specified Policy instances form a chain and are invoked in the order provided to NewPipeline\nfollowed by the Transporter.\n\nOnce the Pipeline has been created, create a runtime.Request instance and pass it to Pipeline's Do method.\n\nThe Pipeline.Do method sends the specified Request through the chain of Policy and Transporter\ninstances.  The response/error is then sent through the same chain of Policy instances in reverse\norder.  For example, assuming there are Policy types PolicyA, PolicyB, and PolicyC along with\nTransportA.\n\nThe flow of Request and Response looks like the following:\n\nThe Request instance passed to Pipeline's Do method is a wrapper around an *http.Request.  It also\ncontains some internal state and provides various convenience methods.  You create a Request instance\nby calling the runtime.NewRequest function:\n\nIf the Request should contain a body, call the SetBody method.\n\nA seekable stream is required so that upon retry, the retry Policy instance can seek the stream\nback to the beginning before retrying the network request and re-uploading the body.\n\nOperations like JSON-MERGE-PATCH send a JSON null to indicate a value should be deleted.\n\nThis requirement conflicts with the SDK's default marshalling that specifies \"omitempty\" as\na means to resolve the ambiguity between a field to be excluded and its zero-value.\n\nIn the above example, Name and Count are defined as pointer-to-type to disambiguate between\na missing value (nil) and a zero-value (0) which might have semantic differences.\n\nIn a PATCH operation, any fields left as nil are to have their values preserved.  When updating\na Widget's count, one simply specifies the new value for Count, leaving Name nil.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement for sending a JSON null, the NullValue() function can be used.\n\nThis sends an explict \"null\" for Count, indicating that any current value for Count should be deleted.\n\nWhen the HTTP response is received, the *http.Response is returned directly. Each Policy instance\ncan inspect/mutate the *http.Response.\n\nTo enable logging, set environment variable AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING to \"all\" before executing your program.\n\nBy default the logger writes to stderr.  This can be customized by calling log.SetListener, providing\na callback that writes to the desired location.  Any custom logging implementation MUST provide its\nown synchronization to handle concurrent invocations.\n\nSee the docs for the log package for further details.\n\nPageable operations return potentially large data sets spread over multiple GET requests.  The result of\neach GET is a \"page\" of data consisting of a slice of items.\n\nPageable operations can be identified by their New*Pager naming convention and return type of *runtime.Pager[T].\n\nThe call to WidgetClient.NewListWidgetsPager() returns an instance of *runtime.Pager[T] for fetching pages\nand determining if there are more pages to fetch.  No IO calls are made until the NextPage() method is invoked.\n\nLong-running operations (LROs) are operations consisting of an initial request to start the operation followed\nby polling to determine when the operation has reached a terminal state.  An LRO's terminal state is one\nof the following values.\n\nLROs can be identified by their Begin* prefix and their return type of *runtime.Poller[T].\n\nWhen a call to WidgetClient.BeginCreateOrUpdate() returns a nil error, it means that the LRO has started.\nIt does _not_ mean that the widget has been created or updated (or failed to be created/updated).\n\nThe *runtime.Poller[T] provides APIs for determining the state of the LRO.  To wait for the LRO to complete,\ncall the PollUntilDone() method.\n\nThe call to PollUntilDone() will block the current goroutine until the LRO has reached a terminal state or the\ncontext is canceled/timed out.\n\nNote that LROs can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  The duration is operation-dependent.  Due to\nthis variant behavior, pollers do _not_ have a preconfigured time-out.  Use a context with the appropriate cancellation\nmechanism as required.\n\nPollers provide the ability to serialize their state into a \"resume token\" which can be used by another process to\nrecreate the poller.  This is achieved via the runtime.Poller[T].ResumeToken() method.\n\nNote that a token can only be obtained for a poller that's in a non-terminal state.  Also note that any subsequent calls\nto poller.Poll() might change the poller's state.  In this case, a new token should be created.\n\nAfter the token has been obtained, it can be used to recreate an instance of the originating poller.\n\nWhen resuming a poller, no IO is performed, and zero-value arguments can be used for everything but the Options.ResumeToken.\n\nResume tokens are unique per service client and operation.  Attempting to resume a poller for LRO BeginB() with a token from LRO\nBeginA() will result in an error.\n\nThe fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.\nThis allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.\n\nPlease see https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/samples/fakes for details and examples on how to use fakes.",

For example:\n\nThis specifies one option with a short name -v and a long name --verbose.\nWhen either -v or --verbose is found on the command line, a 'true' value\nwill be appended to the Verbose field. e.g. when specifying -vvv, the\nresulting value of Verbose will be {[true, true, true]}.\n\nSlice options work exactly the same as primitive type options, except that\nwhenever the option is encountered, a value is appended to the slice.\n\nMap options from string to primitive type are also supported. On the command\nline, you specify the value for such an option as key:value. For example\n\nThen, the AuthorInfo map can be filled with something like\n-a name:Jesse -a \"surname:van den Kieboom\".\n\nFinally, for full control over the conversion between command line argument\nvalues and options, user defined types can choose to implement the Marshaler\nand Unmarshaler interfaces.\n\nThe following is a list of tags for struct fields supported by go-flags:\n\nEither the `short:` tag or the `long:` must be specified to make the field eligible as an\noption.\n\nOption groups are a simple way to semantically separate your options. All\noptions in a particular group are shown together in the help under the name\nof the group. Namespaces can be used to specify option long names more\nprecisely and emphasize the options affiliation to their group.\n\nThere are currently three ways to specify option groups.\n\nThe flags package also has basic support for commands. Commands are often\nused in monolithic applications that support various commands or actions.\nTake git for example, all of the add, commit, checkout, etc. are called\ncommands. Using commands you can easily separate multiple functions of your\napplication.\n\nThere are currently two ways to specify a command.\n\nThe most common, idiomatic way to implement commands is to define a global\nparser instance and implement each command in a separate file. These\ncommand files should define a go init function which calls AddCommand on\nthe global parser.\n\nWhen parsing ends and there is an active command and that command implements\nthe Commander interface, then its Execute method will be run with the\nremaining command line arguments.\n\nCommand structs can have options which become valid to parse after the\ncommand has been specified on the command line, in addition to the options\nof all the parent commands. I.e. considering a -v flag on the parser and an\nadd command, the following are equivalent:\n\nHowever, if the -v flag is defined on the add command, then the first of\nthe two examples above would fail since the -v flag is not defined before\nthe add command.\n\ngo-flags has builtin support to provide bash completion of flags, commands\nand argument values. To use completion, the binary which uses go-flags\ncan be invoked in a special environment to list completion of the current\ncommand line argument. It should be noted that this `executes` your application,\nand it is up to the user to make sure there are no negative side effects (for\nexample from init functions).\n\nSetting the environment variable `GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION=1` enables completion\nby replacing the argument parsing routine with the completion routine which\noutputs completions for the passed arguments. The basic invocation to\ncomplete a set of arguments is therefore:\n\nwhere `completion-example` is the binary, `arg1` and `arg2` are\nthe current arguments, and `arg3` (the last argument) is the argument\nto be completed. If the GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set to \"verbose\", then\ndescriptions of possible completion items will also be shown, if there\nare more than 1 completion items.\n\nTo use this with bash completion, a simple file can be written which\ncalls the binary which supports go-flags completion:\n\nCompletion requires the parser option PassDoubleDash and is therefore enforced if the environment variable GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set.\n\nCustomized completion for argument values is supported by implementing\nthe flags.Completer interface for the argument value type. An example\nof a type which does so is the flags.Filename type, an alias of string\nallowing simple filename completion. A slice or array argument value\nwhose element type implements flags.Completer will also be completed.",

      "description": "Package azcore implements an HTTP request/response middleware pipeline used by Azure SDK clients.\n\nThe middleware consists of three components.\n\nA Policy can be implemented in two ways; as a first-class function for a stateless Policy, or as\na method on a type for a stateful Policy.  Note that HTTP requests made via the same pipeline share\nthe same Policy instances, so if a Policy mutates its state it MUST be properly synchronized to\navoid race conditions.\n\nA Policy's Do method is called when an HTTP request wants to be sent over the network. The Do method can\nperform any operation(s) it desires. For example, it can log the outgoing request, mutate the URL, headers,\nand/or query parameters, inject a failure, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its request\nwork, it must call the Next() method on the *policy.Request instance in order to pass the request to the\nnext Policy in the chain.\n\nWhen an HTTP response comes back, the Policy then gets a chance to process the response/error.  The Policy instance\ncan log the response, retry the operation if it failed due to a transient error or timeout, unmarshal the response\nbody, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its response work, it must return the *http.Response\nand error instances to its caller.\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateless Policy:\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateful Policy:\n\nThe Transporter interface is responsible for sending the HTTP request and returning the corresponding\nHTTP response or error.  The Transporter is invoked by the last Policy in the chain.  The default Transporter\nimplementation uses a shared http.Client from the standard library.\n\nThe same stateful/stateless rules for Policy implementations apply to Transporter implementations.\n\nTo use the Policy and Transporter instances, an application passes them to the runtime.NewPipeline function.\n\nThe specified Policy instances form a chain and are invoked in the order provided to NewPipeline\nfollowed by the Transporter.\n\nOnce the Pipeline has been created, create a runtime.Request instance and pass it to Pipeline's Do method.\n\nThe Pipeline.Do method sends the specified Request through the chain of Policy and Transporter\ninstances.  The response/error is then sent through the same chain of Policy instances in reverse\norder.  For example, assuming there are Policy types PolicyA, PolicyB, and PolicyC along with\nTransportA.\n\nThe flow of Request and Response looks like the following:\n\nThe Request instance passed to Pipeline's Do method is a wrapper around an *http.Request.  It also\ncontains some internal state and provides various convenience methods.  You create a Request instance\nby calling the runtime.NewRequest function:\n\nIf the Request should contain a body, call the SetBody method.\n\nA seekable stream is required so that upon retry, the retry Policy instance can seek the stream\nback to the beginning before retrying the network request and re-uploading the body.\n\nOperations like JSON-MERGE-PATCH send a JSON null to indicate a value should be deleted.\n\nThis requirement conflicts with the SDK's default marshalling that specifies \"omitempty\" as\na means to resolve the ambiguity between a field to be excluded and its zero-value.\n\nIn the above example, Name and Count are defined as pointer-to-type to disambiguate between\na missing value (nil) and a zero-value (0) which might have semantic differences.\n\nIn a PATCH operation, any fields left as nil are to have their values preserved.  When updating\na Widget's count, one simply specifies the new value for Count, leaving Name nil.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement for sending a JSON null, the NullValue() function can be used.\n\nThis sends an explict \"null\" for Count, indicating that any current value for Count should be deleted.\n\nWhen the HTTP response is received, the *http.Response is returned directly. Each Policy instance\ncan inspect/mutate the *http.Response.\n\nTo enable logging, set environment variable AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING to \"all\" before executing your program.\n\nBy default the logger writes to stderr.  This can be customized by calling log.SetListener, providing\na callback that writes to the desired location.  Any custom logging implementation MUST provide its\nown synchronization to handle concurrent invocations.\n\nSee the docs for the log package for further details.\n\nPageable operations return potentially large data sets spread over multiple GET requests.  The result of\neach GET is a \"page\" of data consisting of a slice of items.\n\nPageable operations can be identified by their New*Pager naming convention and return type of *runtime.Pager[T].\n\nThe call to WidgetClient.NewListWidgetsPager() returns an instance of *runtime.Pager[T] for fetching pages\nand determining if there are more pages to fetch.  No IO calls are made until the NextPage() method is invoked.\n\nLong-running operations (LROs) are operations consisting of an initial request to start the operation followed\nby polling to determine when the operation has reached a terminal state.  An LRO's terminal state is one\nof the following values.\n\nLROs can be identified by their Begin* prefix and their return type of *runtime.Poller[T].\n\nWhen a call to WidgetClient.BeginCreateOrUpdate() returns a nil error, it means that the LRO has started.\nIt does _not_ mean that the widget has been created or updated (or failed to be created/updated).\n\nThe *runtime.Poller[T] provides APIs for determining the state of the LRO.  To wait for the LRO to complete,\ncall the PollUntilDone() method.\n\nThe call to PollUntilDone() will block the current goroutine until the LRO has reached a terminal state or the\ncontext is canceled/timed out.\n\nNote that LROs can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  The duration is operation-dependent.  Due to\nthis variant behavior, pollers do _not_ have a preconfigured time-out.  Use a context with the appropriate cancellation\nmechanism as required.\n\nPollers provide the ability to serialize their state into a \"resume token\" which can be used by another process to\nrecreate the poller.  This is achieved via the runtime.Poller[T].ResumeToken() method.\n\nNote that a token can only be obtained for a poller that's in a non-terminal state.  Also note that any subsequent calls\nto poller.Poll() might change the poller's state.  In this case, a new token should be created.\n\nAfter the token has been obtained, it can be used to recreate an instance of the originating poller.\n\nWhen resuming a poller, no IO is performed, and zero-value arguments can be used for everything but the Options.ResumeToken.\n\nResume tokens are unique per service client and operation.  Attempting to resume a poller for LRO BeginB() with a token from LRO\nBeginA() will result in an error.\n\nThe fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.\nThis allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.\n\nPlease see https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/samples/fakes for details and examples on how to use fakes.",

The errors package allows\nprogrammers to add context to the failure path in their code in a way\nthat does not destroy the original value of the error.\n\nThe errors.Wrap function returns a new error that adds context to the\noriginal error by recording a stack trace at the point Wrap is called,\ntogether with the supplied message. For example\n\nIf additional control is required, the errors.WithStack and\nerrors.WithMessage functions destructure errors.Wrap into its component\noperations: annotating an error with a stack trace and with a message,\nrespectively.\n\nUsing errors.Wrap constructs a stack of errors, adding context to the\npreceding error. Depending on the nature of the error it may be necessary\nto reverse the operation of errors.Wrap to retrieve the original error\nfor inspection. Any error value which implements this interface\n\ncan be inspected by errors.Cause. errors.Cause will recursively retrieve\nthe topmost error that does not implement causer, which is assumed to be\nthe original cause. For example:\n\nAlthough the causer interface is not exported by this package, it is\nconsidered a part of its stable public interface.\n\nAll error values returned from this package implement fmt.Formatter and can\nbe formatted by the fmt package. The following verbs are supported:\n\nNew, Errorf, Wrap, and Wrapf record a stack trace at the point they are\ninvoked. This information can be retrieved with the following interface:\n\nThe returned errors.StackTrace type is defined as\n\nThe Frame type represents a call site in the stack trace. Frame supports\nthe fmt.Formatter interface that can be used for printing information about\nthe stack trace of this error. For example:\n\nAlthough the stackTracer interface is not exported by this package, it is\nconsidered a part of its stable public interface.\n\nSee the documentation for Frame.Format for more details.",

      "version": "v1.17.0",
      "description": "Package azcore implements an HTTP request/response middleware pipeline used by Azure SDK clients.\n\nThe middleware consists of three components.\n\nA Policy can be implemented in two ways; as a first-class function for a stateless Policy, or as\na method on a type for a stateful Policy.  Note that HTTP requests made via the same pipeline share\nthe same Policy instances, so if a Policy mutates its state it MUST be properly synchronized to\navoid race conditions.\n\nA Policy's Do method is called when an HTTP request wants to be sent over the network. The Do method can\nperform any operation(s) it desires. For example, it can log the outgoing request, mutate the URL, headers,\nand/or query parameters, inject a failure, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its request\nwork, it must call the Next() method on the *policy.Request instance in order to pass the request to the\nnext Policy in the chain.\n\nWhen an HTTP response comes back, the Policy then gets a chance to process the response/error.  The Policy instance\ncan log the response, retry the operation if it failed due to a transient error or timeout, unmarshal the response\nbody, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its response work, it must return the *http.Response\nand error instances to its caller.\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateless Policy:\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateful Policy:\n\nThe Transporter interface is responsible for sending the HTTP request and returning the corresponding\nHTTP response or error.  The Transporter is invoked by the last Policy in the chain.  The default Transporter\nimplementation uses a shared http.Client from the standard library.\n\nThe same stateful/stateless rules for Policy implementations apply to Transporter implementations.\n\nTo use the Policy and Transporter instances, an application passes them to the runtime.NewPipeline function.\n\nThe specified Policy instances form a chain and are invoked in the order provided to NewPipeline\nfollowed by the Transporter.\n\nOnce the Pipeline has been created, create a runtime.Request instance and pass it to Pipeline's Do method.\n\nThe Pipeline.Do method sends the specified Request through the chain of Policy and Transporter\ninstances.  The response/error is then sent through the same chain of Policy instances in reverse\norder.  For example, assuming there are Policy types PolicyA, PolicyB, and PolicyC along with\nTransportA.\n\nThe flow of Request and Response looks like the following:\n\nThe Request instance passed to Pipeline's Do method is a wrapper around an *http.Request.  It also\ncontains some internal state and provides various convenience methods.  You create a Request instance\nby calling the runtime.NewRequest function:\n\nIf the Request should contain a body, call the SetBody method.\n\nA seekable stream is required so that upon retry, the retry Policy instance can seek the stream\nback to the beginning before retrying the network request and re-uploading the body.\n\nOperations like JSON-MERGE-PATCH send a JSON null to indicate a value should be deleted.\n\nThis requirement conflicts with the SDK's default marshalling that specifies \"omitempty\" as\na means to resolve the ambiguity between a field to be excluded and its zero-value.\n\nIn the above example, Name and Count are defined as pointer-to-type to disambiguate between\na missing value (nil) and a zero-value (0) which might have semantic differences.\n\nIn a PATCH operation, any fields left as nil are to have their values preserved.  When updating\na Widget's count, one simply specifies the new value for Count, leaving Name nil.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement for sending a JSON null, the NullValue() function can be used.\n\nThis sends an explict \"null\" for Count, indicating that any current value for Count should be deleted.\n\nWhen the HTTP response is received, the *http.Response is returned directly. Each Policy instance\ncan inspect/mutate the *http.Response.\n\nTo enable logging, set environment variable AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING to \"all\" before executing your program.\n\nBy default the logger writes to stderr.  This can be customized by calling log.SetListener, providing\na callback that writes to the desired location.  Any custom logging implementation MUST provide its\nown synchronization to handle concurrent invocations.\n\nSee the docs for the log package for further details.\n\nPageable operations return potentially large data sets spread over multiple GET requests.  The result of\neach GET is a \"page\" of data consisting of a slice of items.\n\nPageable operations can be identified by their New*Pager naming convention and return type of *runtime.Pager[T].\n\nThe call to WidgetClient.NewListWidgetsPager() returns an instance of *runtime.Pager[T] for fetching pages\nand determining if there are more pages to fetch.  No IO calls are made until the NextPage() method is invoked.\n\nLong-running operations (LROs) are operations consisting of an initial request to start the operation followed\nby polling to determine when the operation has reached a terminal state.  An LRO's terminal state is one\nof the following values.\n\nLROs can be identified by their Begin* prefix and their return type of *runtime.Poller[T].\n\nWhen a call to WidgetClient.BeginCreateOrUpdate() returns a nil error, it means that the LRO has started.\nIt does _not_ mean that the widget has been created or updated (or failed to be created/updated).\n\nThe *runtime.Poller[T] provides APIs for determining the state of the LRO.  To wait for the LRO to complete,\ncall the PollUntilDone() method.\n\nThe call to PollUntilDone() will block the current goroutine until the LRO has reached a terminal state or the\ncontext is canceled/timed out.\n\nNote that LROs can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  The duration is operation-dependent.  Due to\nthis variant behavior, pollers do _not_ have a preconfigured time-out.  Use a context with the appropriate cancellation\nmechanism as required.\n\nPollers provide the ability to serialize their state into a \"resume token\" which can be used by another process to\nrecreate the poller.  This is achieved via the runtime.Poller[T].ResumeToken() method.\n\nNote that a token can only be obtained for a poller that's in a non-terminal state.  Also note that any subsequent calls\nto poller.Poll() might change the poller's state.  In this case, a new token should be created.\n\nAfter the token has been obtained, it can be used to recreate an instance of the originating poller.\n\nWhen resuming a poller, no IO is performed, and zero-value arguments can be used for everything but the Options.ResumeToken.\n\nResume tokens are unique per service client and operation.  Attempting to resume a poller for LRO BeginB() with a token from LRO\nBeginA() will result in an error.\n\nThe fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.\nThis allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.\n\nPlease see https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/samples/fakes for details and examples on how to use fakes.",

The default implementation is safe for concurrent\naccess, but a non-thread-safe implementation is also provided for\nprograms that can benefit from the slight speed improvement and\nthat can enforce mutual exclusion through other means.",

      "description": "Package flags provides an extensive command line option parser.\nThe flags package is similar in functionality to the go built-in flag package\nbut provides more options and uses reflection to provide a convenient and\nsuccinct way of specifying command line options.\n\nThe following features are supported in go-flags:\n\nAdditional features specific to Windows:\n\nThe flags package uses structs, reflection and struct field tags\nto allow users to specify command line options. This results in very simple\nand concise specification of your application options. For example:\n\nThis specifies one option with a short name -v and a long name --verbose.\nWhen either -v or --verbose is found on the command line, a 'true' value\nwill be appended to the Verbose field. e.g. when specifying -vvv, the\nresulting value of Verbose will be {[true, true, true]}.\n\nSlice options work exactly the same as primitive type options, except that\nwhenever the option is encountered, a value is appended to the slice.\n\nMap options from string to primitive type are also supported. On the command\nline, you specify the value for such an option as key:value. For example\n\nThen, the AuthorInfo map can be filled with something like\n-a name:Jesse -a \"surname:van den Kieboom\".\n\nFinally, for full control over the conversion between command line argument\nvalues and options, user defined types can choose to implement the Marshaler\nand Unmarshaler interfaces.\n\nThe following is a list of tags for struct fields supported by go-flags:\n\nEither the `short:` tag or the `long:` must be specified to make the field eligible as an\noption.\n\nOption groups are a simple way to semantically separate your options. All\noptions in a particular group are shown together in the help under the name\nof the group. Namespaces can be used to specify option long names more\nprecisely and emphasize the options affiliation to their group.\n\nThere are currently three ways to specify option groups.\n\nThe flags package also has basic support for commands. Commands are often\nused in monolithic applications that support various commands or actions.\nTake git for example, all of the add, commit, checkout, etc. are called\ncommands. Using commands you can easily separate multiple functions of your\napplication.\n\nThere are currently two ways to specify a command.\n\nThe most common, idiomatic way to implement commands is to define a global\nparser instance and implement each command in a separate file. These\ncommand files should define a go init function which calls AddCommand on\nthe global parser.\n\nWhen parsing ends and there is an active command and that command implements\nthe Commander interface, then its Execute method will be run with the\nremaining command line arguments.\n\nCommand structs can have options which become valid to parse after the\ncommand has been specified on the command line, in addition to the options\nof all the parent commands. I.e. considering a -v flag on the parser and an\nadd command, the following are equivalent:\n\nHowever, if the -v flag is defined on the add command, then the first of\nthe two examples above would fail since the -v flag is not defined before\nthe add command.\n\ngo-flags has builtin support to provide bash completion of flags, commands\nand argument values. To use completion, the binary which uses go-flags\ncan be invoked in a special environment to list completion of the current\ncommand line argument. It should be noted that this `executes` your application,\nand it is up to the user to make sure there are no negative side effects (for\nexample from init functions).\n\nSetting the environment variable `GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION=1` enables completion\nby replacing the argument parsing routine with the completion routine which\noutputs completions for the passed arguments. The basic invocation to\ncomplete a set of arguments is therefore:\n\nwhere `completion-example` is the binary, `arg1` and `arg2` are\nthe current arguments, and `arg3` (the last argument) is the argument\nto be completed. If the GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set to \"verbose\", then\ndescriptions of possible completion items will also be shown, if there\nare more than 1 completion items.\n\nTo use this with bash completion, a simple file can be written which\ncalls the binary which supports go-flags completion:\n\nCompletion requires the parser option PassDoubleDash and is therefore enforced if the environment variable GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set.\n\nCustomized completion for argument values is supported by implementing\nthe flags.Completer interface for the argument value type. An example\nof a type which does so is the flags.Filename type, an alias of string\nallowing simple filename completion. A slice or array argument value\nwhose element type implements flags.Completer will also be completed.",

      "version": "v1.17.0",
      "description": "Package azcore implements an HTTP request/response middleware pipeline used by Azure SDK clients.\n\nThe middleware consists of three components.\n\nA Policy can be implemented in two ways; as a first-class function for a stateless Policy, or as\na method on a type for a stateful Policy.  Note that HTTP requests made via the same pipeline share\nthe same Policy instances, so if a Policy mutates its state it MUST be properly synchronized to\navoid race conditions.\n\nA Policy's Do method is called when an HTTP request wants to be sent over the network. The Do method can\nperform any operation(s) it desires. For example, it can log the outgoing request, mutate the URL, headers,\nand/or query parameters, inject a failure, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its request\nwork, it must call the Next() method on the *policy.Request instance in order to pass the request to the\nnext Policy in the chain.\n\nWhen an HTTP response comes back, the Policy then gets a chance to process the response/error.  The Policy instance\ncan log the response, retry the operation if it failed due to a transient error or timeout, unmarshal the response\nbody, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its response work, it must return the *http.Response\nand error instances to its caller.\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateless Policy:\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateful Policy:\n\nThe Transporter interface is responsible for sending the HTTP request and returning the corresponding\nHTTP response or error.  The Transporter is invoked by the last Policy in the chain.  The default Transporter\nimplementation uses a shared http.Client from the standard library.\n\nThe same stateful/stateless rules for Policy implementations apply to Transporter implementations.\n\nTo use the Policy and Transporter instances, an application passes them to the runtime.NewPipeline function.\n\nThe specified Policy instances form a chain and are invoked in the order provided to NewPipeline\nfollowed by the Transporter.\n\nOnce the Pipeline has been created, create a runtime.Request instance and pass it to Pipeline's Do method.\n\nThe Pipeline.Do method sends the specified Request through the chain of Policy and Transporter\ninstances.  The response/error is then sent through the same chain of Policy instances in reverse\norder.  For example, assuming there are Policy types PolicyA, PolicyB, and PolicyC along with\nTransportA.\n\nThe flow of Request and Response looks like the following:\n\nThe Request instance passed to Pipeline's Do method is a wrapper around an *http.Request.  It also\ncontains some internal state and provides various convenience methods.  You create a Request instance\nby calling the runtime.NewRequest function:\n\nIf the Request should contain a body, call the SetBody method.\n\nA seekable stream is required so that upon retry, the retry Policy instance can seek the stream\nback to the beginning before retrying the network request and re-uploading the body.\n\nOperations like JSON-MERGE-PATCH send a JSON null to indicate a value should be deleted.\n\nThis requirement conflicts with the SDK's default marshalling that specifies \"omitempty\" as\na means to resolve the ambiguity between a field to be excluded and its zero-value.\n\nIn the above example, Name and Count are defined as pointer-to-type to disambiguate between\na missing value (nil) and a zero-value (0) which might have semantic differences.\n\nIn a PATCH operation, any fields left as nil are to have their values preserved.  When updating\na Widget's count, one simply specifies the new value for Count, leaving Name nil.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement for sending a JSON null, the NullValue() function can be used.\n\nThis sends an explict \"null\" for Count, indicating that any current value for Count should be deleted.\n\nWhen the HTTP response is received, the *http.Response is returned directly. Each Policy instance\ncan inspect/mutate the *http.Response.\n\nTo enable logging, set environment variable AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING to \"all\" before executing your program.\n\nBy default the logger writes to stderr.  This can be customized by calling log.SetListener, providing\na callback that writes to the desired location.  Any custom logging implementation MUST provide its\nown synchronization to handle concurrent invocations.\n\nSee the docs for the log package for further details.\n\nPageable operations return potentially large data sets spread over multiple GET requests.  The result of\neach GET is a \"page\" of data consisting of a slice of items.\n\nPageable operations can be identified by their New*Pager naming convention and return type of *runtime.Pager[T].\n\nThe call to WidgetClient.NewListWidgetsPager() returns an instance of *runtime.Pager[T] for fetching pages\nand determining if there are more pages to fetch.  No IO calls are made until the NextPage() method is invoked.\n\nLong-running operations (LROs) are operations consisting of an initial request to start the operation followed\nby polling to determine when the operation has reached a terminal state.  An LRO's terminal state is one\nof the following values.\n\nLROs can be identified by their Begin* prefix and their return type of *runtime.Poller[T].\n\nWhen a call to WidgetClient.BeginCreateOrUpdate() returns a nil error, it means that the LRO has started.\nIt does _not_ mean that the widget has been created or updated (or failed to be created/updated).\n\nThe *runtime.Poller[T] provides APIs for determining the state of the LRO.  To wait for the LRO to complete,\ncall the PollUntilDone() method.\n\nThe call to PollUntilDone() will block the current goroutine until the LRO has reached a terminal state or the\ncontext is canceled/timed out.\n\nNote that LROs can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  The duration is operation-dependent.  Due to\nthis variant behavior, pollers do _not_ have a preconfigured time-out.  Use a context with the appropriate cancellation\nmechanism as required.\n\nPollers provide the ability to serialize their state into a \"resume token\" which can be used by another process to\nrecreate the poller.  This is achieved via the runtime.Poller[T].ResumeToken() method.\n\nNote that a token can only be obtained for a poller that's in a non-terminal state.  Also note that any subsequent calls\nto poller.Poll() might change the poller's state.  In this case, a new token should be created.\n\nAfter the token has been obtained, it can be used to recreate an instance of the originating poller.\n\nWhen resuming a poller, no IO is performed, and zero-value arguments can be used for everything but the Options.ResumeToken.\n\nResume tokens are unique per service client and operation.  Attempting to resume a poller for LRO BeginB() with a token from LRO\nBeginA() will result in an error.\n\nThe fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.\nThis allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.\n\nPlease see https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/samples/fakes for details and examples on how to use fakes.",

The errors package allows\nprogrammers to add context to the failure path in their code in a way\nthat does not destroy the original value of the error.\n\nThe errors.Wrap function returns a new error that adds context to the\noriginal error by recording a stack trace at the point Wrap is called,\ntogether with the supplied message. For example\n\nIf additional control is required, the errors.WithStack and\nerrors.WithMessage functions destructure errors.Wrap into its component\noperations: annotating an error with a stack trace and with a message,\nrespectively.\n\nUsing errors.Wrap constructs a stack of errors, adding context to the\npreceding error. Depending on the nature of the error it may be necessary\nto reverse the operation of errors.Wrap to retrieve the original error\nfor inspection. Any error value which implements this interface\n\ncan be inspected by errors.Cause. errors.Cause will recursively retrieve\nthe topmost error that does not implement causer, which is assumed to be\nthe original cause. For example:\n\nAlthough the causer interface is not exported by this package, it is\nconsidered a part of its stable public interface.\n\nAll error values returned from this package implement fmt.Formatter and can\nbe formatted by the fmt package. The following verbs are supported:\n\nNew, Errorf, Wrap, and Wrapf record a stack trace at the point they are\ninvoked. This information can be retrieved with the following interface:\n\nThe returned errors.StackTrace type is defined as\n\nThe Frame type represents a call site in the stack trace. Frame supports\nthe fmt.Formatter interface that can be used for printing information about\nthe stack trace of this error.

      "description": "Package errors provides simple error handling primitives.\n\nThe traditional error handling idiom in Go is roughly akin to\n\nwhich when applied recursively up the call stack results in error reports\nwithout context or debugging information. The errors package allows\nprogrammers to add context to the failure path in their code in a way\nthat does not destroy the original value of the error.\n\nThe errors.Wrap function returns a new error that adds context to the\noriginal error by recording a stack trace at the point Wrap is called,\ntogether with the supplied message. For example\n\nIf additional control is required, the errors.WithStack and\nerrors.WithMessage functions destructure errors.Wrap into its component\noperations: annotating an error with a stack trace and with a message,\nrespectively.\n\nUsing errors.Wrap constructs a stack of errors, adding context to the\npreceding error. Depending on the nature of the error it may be necessary\nto reverse the operation of errors.Wrap to retrieve the original error\nfor inspection. Any error value which implements this interface\n\ncan be inspected by errors.Cause. errors.Cause will recursively retrieve\nthe topmost error that does not implement causer, which is assumed to be\nthe original cause. For example:\n\nAlthough the causer interface is not exported by this package, it is\nconsidered a part of its stable public interface.\n\nAll error values returned from this package implement fmt.Formatter and can\nbe formatted by the fmt package. The following verbs are supported:\n\nNew, Errorf, Wrap, and Wrapf record a stack trace at the point they are\ninvoked. This information can be retrieved with the following interface:\n\nThe returned errors.StackTrace type is defined as\n\nThe Frame type represents a call site in the stack trace. Frame supports\nthe fmt.Formatter interface that can be used for printing information about\nthe stack trace of this error. For example:\n\nAlthough the stackTracer interface is not exported by this package, it is\nconsidered a part of its stable public interface.\n\nSee the documentation for Frame.Format for more details.",

      "version": "v1.17.0",
      "description": "Package azcore implements an HTTP request/response middleware pipeline used by Azure SDK clients.\n\nThe middleware consists of three components.\n\nA Policy can be implemented in two ways; as a first-class function for a stateless Policy, or as\na method on a type for a stateful Policy.  Note that HTTP requests made via the same pipeline share\nthe same Policy instances, so if a Policy mutates its state it MUST be properly synchronized to\navoid race conditions.\n\nA Policy's Do method is called when an HTTP request wants to be sent over the network. The Do method can\nperform any operation(s) it desires. For example, it can log the outgoing request, mutate the URL, headers,\nand/or query parameters, inject a failure, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its request\nwork, it must call the Next() method on the *policy.Request instance in order to pass the request to the\nnext Policy in the chain.\n\nWhen an HTTP response comes back, the Policy then gets a chance to process the response/error.  The Policy instance\ncan log the response, retry the operation if it failed due to a transient error or timeout, unmarshal the response\nbody, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its response work, it must return the *http.Response\nand error instances to its caller.\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateless Policy:\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateful Policy:\n\nThe Transporter interface is responsible for sending the HTTP request and returning the corresponding\nHTTP response or error.  The Transporter is invoked by the last Policy in the chain.  The default Transporter\nimplementation uses a shared http.Client from the standard library.\n\nThe same stateful/stateless rules for Policy implementations apply to Transporter implementations.\n\nTo use the Policy and Transporter instances, an application passes them to the runtime.NewPipeline function.\n\nThe specified Policy instances form a chain and are invoked in the order provided to NewPipeline\nfollowed by the Transporter.\n\nOnce the Pipeline has been created, create a runtime.Request instance and pass it to Pipeline's Do method.\n\nThe Pipeline.Do method sends the specified Request through the chain of Policy and Transporter\ninstances.  The response/error is then sent through the same chain of Policy instances in reverse\norder.  For example, assuming there are Policy types PolicyA, PolicyB, and PolicyC along with\nTransportA.\n\nThe flow of Request and Response looks like the following:\n\nThe Request instance passed to Pipeline's Do method is a wrapper around an *http.Request.  It also\ncontains some internal state and provides various convenience methods.  You create a Request instance\nby calling the runtime.NewRequest function:\n\nIf the Request should contain a body, call the SetBody method.\n\nA seekable stream is required so that upon retry, the retry Policy instance can seek the stream\nback to the beginning before retrying the network request and re-uploading the body.\n\nOperations like JSON-MERGE-PATCH send a JSON null to indicate a value should be deleted.\n\nThis requirement conflicts with the SDK's default marshalling that specifies \"omitempty\" as\na means to resolve the ambiguity between a field to be excluded and its zero-value.\n\nIn the above example, Name and Count are defined as pointer-to-type to disambiguate between\na missing value (nil) and a zero-value (0) which might have semantic differences.\n\nIn a PATCH operation, any fields left as nil are to have their values preserved.  When updating\na Widget's count, one simply specifies the new value for Count, leaving Name nil.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement for sending a JSON null, the NullValue() function can be used.\n\nThis sends an explict \"null\" for Count, indicating that any current value for Count should be deleted.\n\nWhen the HTTP response is received, the *http.Response is returned directly. Each Policy instance\ncan inspect/mutate the *http.Response.\n\nTo enable logging, set environment variable AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING to \"all\" before executing your program.\n\nBy default the logger writes to stderr.  This can be customized by calling log.SetListener, providing\na callback that writes to the desired location.  Any custom logging implementation MUST provide its\nown synchronization to handle concurrent invocations.\n\nSee the docs for the log package for further details.\n\nPageable operations return potentially large data sets spread over multiple GET requests.  The result of\neach GET is a \"page\" of data consisting of a slice of items.\n\nPageable operations can be identified by their New*Pager naming convention and return type of *runtime.Pager[T].\n\nThe call to WidgetClient.NewListWidgetsPager() returns an instance of *runtime.Pager[T] for fetching pages\nand determining if there are more pages to fetch.  No IO calls are made until the NextPage() method is invoked.\n\nLong-running operations (LROs) are operations consisting of an initial request to start the operation followed\nby polling to determine when the operation has reached a terminal state.  An LRO's terminal state is one\nof the following values.\n\nLROs can be identified by their Begin* prefix and their return type of *runtime.Poller[T].\n\nWhen a call to WidgetClient.BeginCreateOrUpdate() returns a nil error, it means that the LRO has started.\nIt does _not_ mean that the widget has been created or updated (or failed to be created/updated).\n\nThe *runtime.Poller[T] provides APIs for determining the state of the LRO.  To wait for the LRO to complete,\ncall the PollUntilDone() method.\n\nThe call to PollUntilDone() will block the current goroutine until the LRO has reached a terminal state or the\ncontext is canceled/timed out.\n\nNote that LROs can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  The duration is operation-dependent.  Due to\nthis variant behavior, pollers do _not_ have a preconfigured time-out.  Use a context with the appropriate cancellation\nmechanism as required.\n\nPollers provide the ability to serialize their state into a \"resume token\" which can be used by another process to\nrecreate the poller.  This is achieved via the runtime.Poller[T].ResumeToken() method.\n\nNote that a token can only be obtained for a poller that's in a non-terminal state.  Also note that any subsequent calls\nto poller.Poll() might change the poller's state.  In this case, a new token should be created.\n\nAfter the token has been obtained, it can be used to recreate an instance of the originating poller.\n\nWhen resuming a poller, no IO is performed, and zero-value arguments can be used for everything but the Options.ResumeToken.\n\nResume tokens are unique per service client and operation.  Attempting to resume a poller for LRO BeginB() with a token from LRO\nBeginA() will result in an error.\n\nThe fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.\nThis allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.\n\nPlease see https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/samples/fakes for details and examples on how to use fakes.",

      "description": "Package uniseg implements Unicode Text Segmentation, Unicode Line Breaking, and\nstring width calculation for monospace fonts. Unicode Text Segmentation conforms\nto Unicode Standard Annex #29 (https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/) and Unicode\nLine Breaking conforms to Unicode Standard Annex #14\n(https://unicode.org/reports/tr14/).\n\nIn short, using this package, you can split a string into grapheme clusters\n(what people would usually refer to as a \"character\"), into words, and into\nsentences. Or, in its simplest case, this package allows you to count the number\nof characters in a string, especially when it contains complex characters such\nas emojis, combining characters, or characters from Asian, Arabic, Hebrew, or\nother languages. Additionally, you can use it to implement line breaking (or\n\"word wrapping\"), that is, to determine where text can be broken over to the\nnext line when the width of the line is not big enough to fit the entire text.\nFinally, you can use it to calculate the display width of a string for monospace\nfonts.\n\nIf you just want to count the number of characters in a string, you can use\nGraphemeClusterCount. If you want to determine the display width of a string,\nyou can use StringWidth. If you want to iterate over a string, you can use\nStep, StepString, or the Graphemes class (more convenient but less\nperformant). This will provide you with all information: grapheme clusters,\nword boundaries, sentence boundaries, line breaks, and monospace character\nwidths. The specialized functions FirstGraphemeCluster,\nFirstGraphemeClusterInString, FirstWord, FirstWordInString,\nFirstSentence, and FirstSentenceInString can be used if only one type of\ninformation is needed.\n\nConsider the rainbow flag emoji: 🏳️‍🌈. On most modern systems, it appears as one\ncharacter. But its string representation actually has 14 bytes, so counting\nbytes (or using len(\"🏳️‍🌈\")) will not work as expected. Counting runes won't,\neither: The flag has 4 Unicode code points, thus 4 runes. The stdlib function\nutf8.RuneCountInString(\"🏳️‍🌈\") and len([]rune(\"🏳️‍🌈\")) will both return 4.\n\nThe GraphemeClusterCount function will return 1 for the rainbow flag emoji.\nThe Graphemes class and a variety of functions in this package will allow you to\nsplit strings into its grapheme clusters.\n\nWord boundaries are used in a number of different contexts. The most familiar\nones are selection (double-click mouse selection), cursor movement (\"move to\nnext word\" control-arrow keys), and the dialog option \"Whole Word Search\" for\nsearch and replace. This package provides methods for determining word\nboundaries.\n\nSentence boundaries are often used for triple-click or some other method of\nselecting or iterating through blocks of text that are larger than single words.\nThey are also used to determine whether words occur within the same sentence in\ndatabase queries. This package provides methods for determining sentence\nboundaries.\n\nLine breaking, also known as word wrapping, is the process of breaking a section\nof text into lines such that it will fit in the available width of a page,\nwindow or other display area. This package provides methods to determine the\npositions in a string where a line must be broken, may be broken, or must not be\nbroken.\n\nMonospace width, as referred to in this package, is the width of a string in a\nmonospace font. This is commonly used in terminal user interfaces or text\ndisplays or editors that don't support proportional fonts. A width of 1\ncorresponds to a single character cell. The C function wcswidth() and its\nimplementation in other programming languages is in widespread use for the same\npurpose. However, there is no standard for the calculation of such widths, and\nthis package differs from wcswidth() in a number of ways, presumably to generate\nmore visually pleasing results.\n\nTo start, we assume that every code point has a width of 1, with the following\nexceptions:\n\nFor Hangul grapheme clusters composed of conjoining Jamo and for Regional\nIndicators (flags), all code points except the first one have a width of 0. For\ngrapheme clusters starting with an Extended Pictographic, any additional code\npoint will force a total width of 2, except if the Variation Selector-15\n(U+FE0E) is included, in which case the total width is always 1. Grapheme\nclusters ending with Variation Selector-16 (U+FE0F) have a width of 2.\n\nNote that whether these widths appear correct depends on your application's\nrender engine, to which extent it conforms to the Unicode Standard, and its\nchoice of font.",

      "description": "Package flags provides an extensive command line option parser.\nThe flags package is similar in functionality to the go built-in flag package\nbut provides more options and uses reflection to provide a convenient and\nsuccinct way of specifying command line options.\n\nThe following features are supported in go-flags:\n\nAdditional features specific to Windows:\n\nThe flags package uses structs, reflection and struct field tags\nto allow users to specify command line options. This results in very simple\nand concise specification of your application options. For example:\n\nThis specifies one option with a short name -v and a long name --verbose.\nWhen either -v or --verbose is found on the command line, a 'true' value\nwill be appended to the Verbose field. e.g. when specifying -vvv, the\nresulting value of Verbose will be {[true, true, true]}.\n\nSlice options work exactly the same as primitive type options, except that\nwhenever the option is encountered, a value is appended to the slice.\n\nMap options from string to primitive type are also supported. On the command\nline, you specify the value for such an option as key:value. For example\n\nThen, the AuthorInfo map can be filled with something like\n-a name:Jesse -a \"surname:van den Kieboom\".\n\nFinally, for full control over the conversion between command line argument\nvalues and options, user defined types can choose to implement the Marshaler\nand Unmarshaler interfaces.\n\nThe following is a list of tags for struct fields supported by go-flags:\n\nEither the `short:` tag or the `long:` must be specified to make the field eligible as an\noption.\n\nOption groups are a simple way to semantically separate your options. All\noptions in a particular group are shown together in the help under the name\nof the group. Namespaces can be used to specify option long names more\nprecisely and emphasize the options affiliation to their group.\n\nThere are currently three ways to specify option groups.\n\nThe flags package also has basic support for commands. Commands are often\nused in monolithic applications that support various commands or actions.\nTake git for example, all of the add, commit, checkout, etc. are called\ncommands. Using commands you can easily separate multiple functions of your\napplication.\n\nThere are currently two ways to specify a command.\n\nThe most common, idiomatic way to implement commands is to define a global\nparser instance and implement each command in a separate file. These\ncommand files should define a go init function which calls AddCommand on\nthe global parser.\n\nWhen parsing ends and there is an active command and that command implements\nthe Commander interface, then its Execute method will be run with the\nremaining command line arguments.\n\nCommand structs can have options which become valid to parse after the\ncommand has been specified on the command line, in addition to the options\nof all the parent commands. I.e. considering a -v flag on the parser and an\nadd command, the following are equivalent:\n\nHowever, if the -v flag is defined on the add command, then the first of\nthe two examples above would fail since the -v flag is not defined before\nthe add command.\n\ngo-flags has builtin support to provide bash completion of flags, commands\nand argument values. To use completion, the binary which uses go-flags\ncan be invoked in a special environment to list completion of the current\ncommand line argument. It should be noted that this `executes` your application,\nand it is up to the user to make sure there are no negative side effects (for\nexample from init functions).\n\nSetting the environment variable `GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION=1` enables completion\nby replacing the argument parsing routine with the completion routine which\noutputs completions for the passed arguments. The basic invocation to\ncomplete a set of arguments is therefore:\n\nwhere `completion-example` is the binary, `arg1` and `arg2` are\nthe current arguments, and `arg3` (the last argument) is the argument\nto be completed. If the GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set to \"verbose\", then\ndescriptions of possible completion items will also be shown, if there\nare more than 1 completion items.\n\nTo use this with bash completion, a simple file can be written which\ncalls the binary which supports go-flags completion:\n\nCompletion requires the parser option PassDoubleDash and is therefore enforced if the environment variable GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set.\n\nCustomized completion for argument values is supported by implementing\nthe flags.Completer interface for the argument value type. An example\nof a type which does so is the flags.Filename type, an alias of string\nallowing simple filename completion. A slice or array argument value\nwhose element type implements flags.Completer will also be completed.",

      "description": "Package flags provides an extensive command line option parser.\nThe flags package is similar in functionality to the go built-in flag package\nbut provides more options and uses reflection to provide a convenient and\nsuccinct way of specifying command line options.\n\nThe following features are supported in go-flags:\n\nAdditional features specific to Windows:\n\nThe flags package uses structs, reflection and struct field tags\nto allow users to specify command line options. This results in very simple\nand concise specification of your application options. For example:\n\nThis specifies one option with a short name -v and a long name --verbose.\nWhen either -v or --verbose is found on the command line, a 'true' value\nwill be appended to the Verbose field. e.g. when specifying -vvv, the\nresulting value of Verbose will be {[true, true, true]}.\n\nSlice options work exactly the same as primitive type options, except that\nwhenever the option is encountered, a value is appended to the slice.\n\nMap options from string to primitive type are also supported. On the command\nline, you specify the value for such an option as key:value. For example\n\nThen, the AuthorInfo map can be filled with something like\n-a name:Jesse -a \"surname:van den Kieboom\".\n\nFinally, for full control over the conversion between command line argument\nvalues and options, user defined types can choose to implement the Marshaler\nand Unmarshaler interfaces.\n\nThe following is a list of tags for struct fields supported by go-flags:\n\nEither the `short:` tag or the `long:` must be specified to make the field eligible as an\noption.\n\nOption groups are a simple way to semantically separate your options. All\noptions in a particular group are shown together in the help under the name\nof the group. Namespaces can be used to specify option long names more\nprecisely and emphasize the options affiliation to their group.\n\nThere are currently three ways to specify option groups.\n\nThe flags package also has basic support for commands. Commands are often\nused in monolithic applications that support various commands or actions.\nTake git for example, all of the add, commit, checkout, etc. are called\ncommands. Using commands you can easily separate multiple functions of your\napplication.\n\nThere are currently two ways to specify a command.\n\nThe most common, idiomatic way to implement commands is to define a global\nparser instance and implement each command in a separate file. These\ncommand files should define a go init function which calls AddCommand on\nthe global parser.\n\nWhen parsing ends and there is an active command and that command implements\nthe Commander interface, then its Execute method will be run with the\nremaining command line arguments.\n\nCommand structs can have options which become valid to parse after the\ncommand has been specified on the command line, in addition to the options\nof all the parent commands. I.e. considering a -v flag on the parser and an\nadd command, the following are equivalent:\n\nHowever, if the -v flag is defined on the add command, then the first of\nthe two examples above would fail since the -v flag is not defined before\nthe add command.\n\ngo-flags has builtin support to provide bash completion of flags, commands\nand argument values. To use completion, the binary which uses go-flags\ncan be invoked in a special environment to list completion of the current\ncommand line argument. It should be noted that this `executes` your application,\nand it is up to the user to make sure there are no negative side effects (for\nexample from init functions).\n\nSetting the environment variable `GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION=1` enables completion\nby replacing the argument parsing routine with the completion routine which\noutputs completions for the passed arguments. The basic invocation to\ncomplete a set of arguments is therefore:\n\nwhere `completion-example` is the binary, `arg1` and `arg2` are\nthe current arguments, and `arg3` (the last argument) is the argument\nto be completed. If the GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set to \"verbose\", then\ndescriptions of possible completion items will also be shown, if there\nare more than 1 completion items.\n\nTo use this with bash completion, a simple file can be written which\ncalls the binary which supports go-flags completion:\n\nCompletion requires the parser option PassDoubleDash and is therefore enforced if the environment variable GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set.\n\nCustomized completion for argument values is supported by implementing\nthe flags.Completer interface for the argument value type. An example\nof a type which does so is the flags.Filename type, an alias of string\nallowing simple filename completion. A slice or array argument value\nwhose element type implements flags.Completer will also be completed.",

      "version": "v1.17.0",
      "description": "Package azcore implements an HTTP request/response middleware pipeline used by Azure SDK clients.\n\nThe middleware consists of three components.\n\nA Policy can be implemented in two ways; as a first-class function for a stateless Policy, or as\na method on a type for a stateful Policy.  Note that HTTP requests made via the same pipeline share\nthe same Policy instances, so if a Policy mutates its state it MUST be properly synchronized to\navoid race conditions.\n\nA Policy's Do method is called when an HTTP request wants to be sent over the network. The Do method can\nperform any operation(s) it desires. For example, it can log the outgoing request, mutate the URL, headers,\nand/or query parameters, inject a failure, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its request\nwork, it must call the Next() method on the *policy.Request instance in order to pass the request to the\nnext Policy in the chain.\n\nWhen an HTTP response comes back, the Policy then gets a chance to process the response/error.  The Policy instance\ncan log the response, retry the operation if it failed due to a transient error or timeout, unmarshal the response\nbody, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its response work, it must return the *http.Response\nand error instances to its caller.\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateless Policy:\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateful Policy:\n\nThe Transporter interface is responsible for sending the HTTP request and returning the corresponding\nHTTP response or error.  The Transporter is invoked by the last Policy in the chain.  The default Transporter\nimplementation uses a shared http.Client from the standard library.\n\nThe same stateful/stateless rules for Policy implementations apply to Transporter implementations.\n\nTo use the Policy and Transporter instances, an application passes them to the runtime.NewPipeline function.\n\nThe specified Policy instances form a chain and are invoked in the order provided to NewPipeline\nfollowed by the Transporter.\n\nOnce the Pipeline has been created, create a runtime.Request instance and pass it to Pipeline's Do method.\n\nThe Pipeline.Do method sends the specified Request through the chain of Policy and Transporter\ninstances.  The response/error is then sent through the same chain of Policy instances in reverse\norder.  For example, assuming there are Policy types PolicyA, PolicyB, and PolicyC along with\nTransportA.\n\nThe flow of Request and Response looks like the following:\n\nThe Request instance passed to Pipeline's Do method is a wrapper around an *http.Request.  It also\ncontains some internal state and provides various convenience methods.  You create a Request instance\nby calling the runtime.NewRequest function:\n\nIf the Request should contain a body, call the SetBody method.\n\nA seekable stream is required so that upon retry, the retry Policy instance can seek the stream\nback to the beginning before retrying the network request and re-uploading the body.\n\nOperations like JSON-MERGE-PATCH send a JSON null to indicate a value should be deleted.\n\nThis requirement conflicts with the SDK's default marshalling that specifies \"omitempty\" as\na means to resolve the ambiguity between a field to be excluded and its zero-value.\n\nIn the above example, Name and Count are defined as pointer-to-type to disambiguate between\na missing value (nil) and a zero-value (0) which might have semantic differences.\n\nIn a PATCH operation, any fields left as nil are to have their values preserved.  When updating\na Widget's count, one simply specifies the new value for Count, leaving Name nil.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement for sending a JSON null, the NullValue() function can be used.\n\nThis sends an explict \"null\" for Count, indicating that any current value for Count should be deleted.\n\nWhen the HTTP response is received, the *http.Response is returned directly. Each Policy instance\ncan inspect/mutate the *http.Response.\n\nTo enable logging, set environment variable AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING to \"all\" before executing your program.\n\nBy default the logger writes to stderr.  This can be customized by calling log.SetListener, providing\na callback that writes to the desired location.  Any custom logging implementation MUST provide its\nown synchronization to handle concurrent invocations.\n\nSee the docs for the log package for further details.\n\nPageable operations return potentially large data sets spread over multiple GET requests.  The result of\neach GET is a \"page\" of data consisting of a slice of items.\n\nPageable operations can be identified by their New*Pager naming convention and return type of *runtime.Pager[T].\n\nThe call to WidgetClient.NewListWidgetsPager() returns an instance of *runtime.Pager[T] for fetching pages\nand determining if there are more pages to fetch.  No IO calls are made until the NextPage() method is invoked.\n\nLong-running operations (LROs) are operations consisting of an initial request to start the operation followed\nby polling to determine when the operation has reached a terminal state.  An LRO's terminal state is one\nof the following values.\n\nLROs can be identified by their Begin* prefix and their return type of *runtime.Poller[T].\n\nWhen a call to WidgetClient.BeginCreateOrUpdate() returns a nil error, it means that the LRO has started.\nIt does _not_ mean that the widget has been created or updated (or failed to be created/updated).\n\nThe *runtime.Poller[T] provides APIs for determining the state of the LRO.  To wait for the LRO to complete,\ncall the PollUntilDone() method.\n\nThe call to PollUntilDone() will block the current goroutine until the LRO has reached a terminal state or the\ncontext is canceled/timed out.\n\nNote that LROs can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  The duration is operation-dependent.  Due to\nthis variant behavior, pollers do _not_ have a preconfigured time-out.  Use a context with the appropriate cancellation\nmechanism as required.\n\nPollers provide the ability to serialize their state into a \"resume token\" which can be used by another process to\nrecreate the poller.  This is achieved via the runtime.Poller[T].ResumeToken() method.\n\nNote that a token can only be obtained for a poller that's in a non-terminal state.  Also note that any subsequent calls\nto poller.Poll() might change the poller's state.  In this case, a new token should be created.\n\nAfter the token has been obtained, it can be used to recreate an instance of the originating poller.\n\nWhen resuming a poller, no IO is performed, and zero-value arguments can be used for everything but the Options.ResumeToken.\n\nResume tokens are unique per service client and operation.  Attempting to resume a poller for LRO BeginB() with a token from LRO\nBeginA() will result in an error.\n\nThe fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.\nThis allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.\n\nPlease see https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/samples/fakes for details and examples on how to use fakes.",

      "description": "Package uniseg implements Unicode Text Segmentation, Unicode Line Breaking, and\nstring width calculation for monospace fonts. Unicode Text Segmentation conforms\nto Unicode Standard Annex #29 (https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/) and Unicode\nLine Breaking conforms to Unicode Standard Annex #14\n(https://unicode.org/reports/tr14/).\n\nIn short, using this package, you can split a string into grapheme clusters\n(what people would usually refer to as a \"character\"), into words, and into\nsentences. Or, in its simplest case, this package allows you to count the number\nof characters in a string, especially when it contains complex characters such\nas emojis, combining characters, or characters from Asian, Arabic, Hebrew, or\nother languages. Additionally, you can use it to implement line breaking (or\n\"word wrapping\"), that is, to determine where text can be broken over to the\nnext line when the width of the line is not big enough to fit the entire text.\nFinally, you can use it to calculate the display width of a string for monospace\nfonts.\n\nIf you just want to count the number of characters in a string, you can use\nGraphemeClusterCount. If you want to determine the display width of a string,\nyou can use StringWidth. If you want to iterate over a string, you can use\nStep, StepString, or the Graphemes class (more convenient but less\nperformant). This will provide you with all information: grapheme clusters,\nword boundaries, sentence boundaries, line breaks, and monospace character\nwidths. The specialized functions FirstGraphemeCluster,\nFirstGraphemeClusterInString, FirstWord, FirstWordInString,\nFirstSentence, and FirstSentenceInString can be used if only one type of\ninformation is needed.\n\nConsider the rainbow flag emoji: 🏳️‍🌈. On most modern systems, it appears as one\ncharacter. But its string representation actually has 14 bytes, so counting\nbytes (or using len(\"🏳️‍🌈\")) will not work as expected. Counting runes won't,\neither: The flag has 4 Unicode code points, thus 4 runes. The stdlib function\nutf8.RuneCountInString(\"🏳️‍🌈\") and len([]rune(\"🏳️‍🌈\")) will both return 4.\n\nThe GraphemeClusterCount function will return 1 for the rainbow flag emoji.\nThe Graphemes class and a variety of functions in this package will allow you to\nsplit strings into its grapheme clusters.\n\nWord boundaries are used in a number of different contexts. The most familiar\nones are selection (double-click mouse selection), cursor movement (\"move to\nnext word\" control-arrow keys), and the dialog option \"Whole Word Search\" for\nsearch and replace. This package provides methods for determining word\nboundaries.\n\nSentence boundaries are often used for triple-click or some other method of\nselecting or iterating through blocks of text that are larger than single words.\nThey are also used to determine whether words occur within the same sentence in\ndatabase queries. This package provides methods for determining sentence\nboundaries.\n\nLine breaking, also known as word wrapping, is the process of breaking a section\nof text into lines such that it will fit in the available width of a page,\nwindow or other display area. This package provides methods to determine the\npositions in a string where a line must be broken, may be broken, or must not be\nbroken.\n\nMonospace width, as referred to in this package, is the width of a string in a\nmonospace font. This is commonly used in terminal user interfaces or text\ndisplays or editors that don't support proportional fonts. A width of 1\ncorresponds to a single character cell. The C function wcswidth() and its\nimplementation in other programming languages is in widespread use for the same\npurpose. However, there is no standard for the calculation of such widths, and\nthis package differs from wcswidth() in a number of ways, presumably to generate\nmore visually pleasing results.\n\nTo start, we assume that every code point has a width of 1, with the following\nexceptions:\n\nFor Hangul grapheme clusters composed of conjoining Jamo and for Regional\nIndicators (flags), all code points except the first one have a width of 0. For\ngrapheme clusters starting with an Extended Pictographic, any additional code\npoint will force a total width of 2, except if the Variation Selector-15\n(U+FE0E) is included, in which case the total width is always 1. Grapheme\nclusters ending with Variation Selector-16 (U+FE0F) have a width of 2.\n\nNote that whether these widths appear correct depends on your application's\nrender engine, to which extent it conforms to the Unicode Standard, and its\nchoice of font.",

      "description": "Package flags provides an extensive command line option parser.\nThe flags package is similar in functionality to the go built-in flag package\nbut provides more options and uses reflection to provide a convenient and\nsuccinct way of specifying command line options.\n\nThe following features are supported in go-flags:\n\nAdditional features specific to Windows:\n\nThe flags package uses structs, reflection and struct field tags\nto allow users to specify command line options. This results in very simple\nand concise specification of your application options. For example:\n\nThis specifies one option with a short name -v and a long name --verbose.\nWhen either -v or --verbose is found on the command line, a 'true' value\nwill be appended to the Verbose field. e.g. when specifying -vvv, the\nresulting value of Verbose will be {[true, true, true]}.\n\nSlice options work exactly the same as primitive type options, except that\nwhenever the option is encountered, a value is appended to the slice.\n\nMap options from string to primitive type are also supported. On the command\nline, you specify the value for such an option as key:value. For example\n\nThen, the AuthorInfo map can be filled with something like\n-a name:Jesse -a \"surname:van den Kieboom\".\n\nFinally, for full control over the conversion between command line argument\nvalues and options, user defined types can choose to implement the Marshaler\nand Unmarshaler interfaces.\n\nThe following is a list of tags for struct fields supported by go-flags:\n\nEither the `short:` tag or the `long:` must be specified to make the field eligible as an\noption.\n\nOption groups are a simple way to semantically separate your options. All\noptions in a particular group are shown together in the help under the name\nof the group. Namespaces can be used to specify option long names more\nprecisely and emphasize the options affiliation to their group.\n\nThere are currently three ways to specify option groups.\n\nThe flags package also has basic support for commands. Commands are often\nused in monolithic applications that support various commands or actions.\nTake git for example, all of the add, commit, checkout, etc. are called\ncommands. Using commands you can easily separate multiple functions of your\napplication.\n\nThere are currently two ways to specify a command.\n\nThe most common, idiomatic way to implement commands is to define a global\nparser instance and implement each command in a separate file. These\ncommand files should define a go init function which calls AddCommand on\nthe global parser.\n\nWhen parsing ends and there is an active command and that command implements\nthe Commander interface, then its Execute method will be run with the\nremaining command line arguments.\n\nCommand structs can have options which become valid to parse after the\ncommand has been specified on the command line, in addition to the options\nof all the parent commands. I.e. considering a -v flag on the parser and an\nadd command, the following are equivalent:\n\nHowever, if the -v flag is defined on the add command, then the first of\nthe two examples above would fail since the -v flag is not defined before\nthe add command.\n\ngo-flags has builtin support to provide bash completion of flags, commands\nand argument values. To use completion, the binary which uses go-flags\ncan be invoked in a special environment to list completion of the current\ncommand line argument. It should be noted that this `executes` your application,\nand it is up to the user to make sure there are no negative side effects (for\nexample from init functions).\n\nSetting the environment variable `GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION=1` enables completion\nby replacing the argument parsing routine with the completion routine which\noutputs completions for the passed arguments. The basic invocation to\ncomplete a set of arguments is therefore:\n\nwhere `completion-example` is the binary, `arg1` and `arg2` are\nthe current arguments, and `arg3` (the last argument) is the argument\nto be completed. If the GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set to \"verbose\", then\ndescriptions of possible completion items will also be shown, if there\nare more than 1 completion items.\n\nTo use this with bash completion, a simple file can be written which\ncalls the binary which supports go-flags completion:\n\nCompletion requires the parser option PassDoubleDash and is therefore enforced if the environment variable GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set.\n\nCustomized completion for argument values is supported by implementing\nthe flags.Completer interface for the argument value type. An example\nof a type which does so is the flags.Filename type, an alias of string\nallowing simple filename completion. A slice or array argument value\nwhose element type implements flags.Completer will also be completed.",

Channel binding\ncryptographically binds the SCRAM authentication to an underlying TLS\nconnection, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nTo use channel binding, create conversations with channel binding data\nobtained from the TLS connection:\n\nHelper functions are provided to create ChannelBinding values from TLS connections:\n\nChannel binding is configured on conversations rather than clients or servers\nbecause binding data is connection-specific.\n\nChannel binding type negotiation is not defined by the SCRAM protocol.\nApplications must ensure both client and server agree on the same channel binding\ntype.\n\n\nExampleClient_channelBindingModes demonstrates the three channel binding modes\navailable when creating authentication conversations.",

Channel binding\ncryptographically binds the SCRAM authentication to an underlying TLS\nconnection, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nTo use channel binding, create conversations with channel binding data\nobtained from the TLS connection:\n\nHelper functions are provided to create ChannelBinding values from TLS connections:\n\nChannel binding is configured on conversations rather than clients or servers\nbecause binding data is connection-specific.\n\nChannel binding type negotiation is not defined by the SCRAM protocol.\nApplications must ensure both client and server agree on the same channel binding\ntype.\n\n\nExampleClient_channelBindingModes demonstrates the three channel binding modes\navailable when creating authentication conversations.",

Note that HTTP requests made via the same pipeline share\nthe same Policy instances, so if a Policy mutates its state it MUST be properly synchronized to\navoid race conditions.\n\nA Policy's Do method is called when an HTTP request wants to be sent over the network. The Do method can\nperform any operation(s) it desires. For example, it can log the outgoing request, mutate the URL, headers,\nand/or query parameters, inject a failure, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its request\nwork, it must call the Next() method on the *policy.Request instance in order to pass the request to the\nnext Policy in the chain.\n\nWhen an HTTP response comes back, the Policy then gets a chance to process the response/error.  The Policy instance\ncan log the response, retry the operation if it failed due to a transient error or timeout, unmarshal the response\nbody, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its response work, it must return the *http.Response\nand error instances to its caller.\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateless Policy:\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateful Policy:\n\nThe Transporter interface is responsible for sending the HTTP request and returning the corresponding\nHTTP response or error.  The Transporter is invoked by the last Policy in the chain.  The default Transporter\nimplementation uses a shared http.Client from the standard library.\n\nThe same stateful/stateless rules for Policy implementations apply to Transporter implementations.\n\nTo use the Policy and Transporter instances, an application passes them to the runtime.NewPipeline function.\n\nThe specified Policy instances form a chain and are invoked in the order provided to NewPipeline\nfollowed by the Transporter.\n\nOnce the Pipeline has been created, create a runtime.Request instance and pass it to Pipeline's Do method.\n\nThe Pipeline.Do method sends the specified Request through the chain of Policy and Transporter\ninstances.  The response/error is then sent through the same chain of Policy instances in reverse\norder.  For example, assuming there are Policy types PolicyA, PolicyB, and PolicyC along with\nTransportA.\n\nThe flow of Request and Response looks like the following:\n\nThe Request instance passed to Pipeline's Do method is a wrapper around an *http.Request.  It also\ncontains some internal state and provides various convenience methods.  You create a Request instance\nby calling the runtime.NewRequest function:\n\nIf the Request should contain a body, call the SetBody method.\n\nA seekable stream is required so that upon retry, the retry Policy instance can seek the stream\nback to the beginning before retrying the network request and re-uploading the body.\n\nOperations like JSON-MERGE-PATCH send a JSON null to indicate a value should be deleted.\n\nThis requirement conflicts with the SDK's default marshalling that specifies \"omitempty\" as\na means to resolve the ambiguity between a field to be excluded and its zero-value.\n\nIn the above example, Name and Count are defined as pointer-to-type to disambiguate between\na missing value (nil) and a zero-value (0) which might have semantic differences.\n\nIn a PATCH operation, any fields left as nil are to have their values preserved.  When updating\na Widget's count, one simply specifies the new value for Count, leaving Name nil.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement for sending a JSON null, the NullValue() function can be used.\n\nThis sends an explict \"null\" for Count, indicating that any current value for Count should be deleted.\n\nWhen the HTTP response is received, the *http.Response is returned directly. Each Policy instance\ncan inspect/mutate the *http.Response.\n\nTo enable logging, set environment variable AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING to \"all\" before executing your program.\n\nBy default the logger writes to stderr.  This can be customized by calling log.SetListener, providing\na callback that writes to the desired location.  Any custom logging implementation MUST provide its\nown synchronization to handle concurrent invocations.\n\nSee the docs for the log package for further details.\n\nPageable operations return potentially large data sets spread over multiple GET requests.  The result of\neach GET is a \"page\" of data consisting of a slice of items.\n\nPageable operations can be identified by their New*Pager naming convention and return type of *runtime.Pager[T].\n\nThe call to WidgetClient.NewListWidgetsPager() returns an instance of *runtime.Pager[T] for fetching pages\nand determining if there are more pages to fetch.  No IO calls are made until the NextPage() method is invoked.\n\nLong-running operations (LROs) are operations consisting of an initial request to start the operation followed\nby polling to determine when the operation has reached a terminal state.  An LRO's terminal state is one\nof the following values.\n\nLROs can be identified by their Begin* prefix and their return type of *runtime.Poller[T].\n\nWhen a call to WidgetClient.BeginCreateOrUpdate() returns a nil error, it means that the LRO has started.\nIt does _not_ mean that the widget has been created or updated (or failed to be created/updated).\n\nThe *runtime.Poller[T] provides APIs for determining the state of the LRO.  To wait for the LRO to complete,\ncall the PollUntilDone() method.\n\nThe call to PollUntilDone() will block the current goroutine until the LRO has reached a terminal state or the\ncontext is canceled/timed out.\n\nNote that LROs can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  The duration is operation-dependent.  Due to\nthis variant behavior, pollers do _not_ have a preconfigured time-out.  Use a context with the appropriate cancellation\nmechanism as required.\n\nPollers provide the ability to serialize their state into a \"resume token\" which can be used by another process to\nrecreate the poller.  This is achieved via the runtime.Poller[T].ResumeToken() method.\n\nNote that a token can only be obtained for a poller that's in a non-terminal state.  Also note that any subsequent calls\nto poller.Poll() might change the poller's state.  In this case, a new token should be created.\n\nAfter the token has been obtained, it can be used to recreate an instance of the originating poller.\n\nWhen resuming a poller, no IO is performed, and zero-value arguments can be used for everything but the Options.ResumeToken.\n\nResume tokens are unique per service client and operation.  Attempting to resume a poller for LRO BeginB() with a token from LRO\nBeginA() will result in an error.\n\nThe fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.\nThis allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.\n\nPlease see https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/samples/fakes for details and examples on how to use fakes.",

      "description": "Package flags provides an extensive command line option parser.\nThe flags package is similar in functionality to the go built-in flag package\nbut provides more options and uses reflection to provide a convenient and\nsuccinct way of specifying command line options.\n\nThe following features are supported in go-flags:\n\nAdditional features specific to Windows:\n\nThe flags package uses structs, reflection and struct field tags\nto allow users to specify command line options. This results in very simple\nand concise specification of your application options. For example:\n\nThis specifies one option with a short name -v and a long name --verbose.\nWhen either -v or --verbose is found on the command line, a 'true' value\nwill be appended to the Verbose field. e.g. when specifying -vvv, the\nresulting value of Verbose will be {[true, true, true]}.\n\nSlice options work exactly the same as primitive type options, except that\nwhenever the option is encountered, a value is appended to the slice.\n\nMap options from string to primitive type are also supported. On the command\nline, you specify the value for such an option as key:value. For example\n\nThen, the AuthorInfo map can be filled with something like\n-a name:Jesse -a \"surname:van den Kieboom\".\n\nFinally, for full control over the conversion between command line argument\nvalues and options, user defined types can choose to implement the Marshaler\nand Unmarshaler interfaces.\n\nThe following is a list of tags for struct fields supported by go-flags:\n\nEither the `short:` tag or the `long:` must be specified to make the field eligible as an\noption.\n\nOption groups are a simple way to semantically separate your options. All\noptions in a particular group are shown together in the help under the name\nof the group. Namespaces can be used to specify option long names more\nprecisely and emphasize the options affiliation to their group.\n\nThere are currently three ways to specify option groups.\n\nThe flags package also has basic support for commands. Commands are often\nused in monolithic applications that support various commands or actions.\nTake git for example, all of the add, commit, checkout, etc. are called\ncommands. Using commands you can easily separate multiple functions of your\napplication.\n\nThere are currently two ways to specify a command.\n\nThe most common, idiomatic way to implement commands is to define a global\nparser instance and implement each command in a separate file. These\ncommand files should define a go init function which calls AddCommand on\nthe global parser.\n\nWhen parsing ends and there is an active command and that command implements\nthe Commander interface, then its Execute method will be run with the\nremaining command line arguments.\n\nCommand structs can have options which become valid to parse after the\ncommand has been specified on the command line, in addition to the options\nof all the parent commands. I.e. considering a -v flag on the parser and an\nadd command, the following are equivalent:\n\nHowever, if the -v flag is defined on the add command, then the first of\nthe two examples above would fail since the -v flag is not defined before\nthe add command.\n\ngo-flags has builtin support to provide bash completion of flags, commands\nand argument values. To use completion, the binary which uses go-flags\ncan be invoked in a special environment to list completion of the current\ncommand line argument. It should be noted that this `executes` your application,\nand it is up to the user to make sure there are no negative side effects (for\nexample from init functions).\n\nSetting the environment variable `GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION=1` enables completion\nby replacing the argument parsing routine with the completion routine which\noutputs completions for the passed arguments. The basic invocation to\ncomplete a set of arguments is therefore:\n\nwhere `completion-example` is the binary, `arg1` and `arg2` are\nthe current arguments, and `arg3` (the last argument) is the argument\nto be completed. If the GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set to \"verbose\", then\ndescriptions of possible completion items will also be shown, if there\nare more than 1 completion items.\n\nTo use this with bash completion, a simple file can be written which\ncalls the binary which supports go-flags completion:\n\nCompletion requires the parser option PassDoubleDash and is therefore enforced if the environment variable GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set.\n\nCustomized completion for argument values is supported by implementing\nthe flags.Completer interface for the argument value type. An example\nof a type which does so is the flags.Filename type, an alias of string\nallowing simple filename completion. A slice or array argument value\nwhose element type implements flags.Completer will also be completed.",

      "description": "Package flags provides an extensive command line option parser.\nThe flags package is similar in functionality to the go built-in flag package\nbut provides more options and uses reflection to provide a convenient and\nsuccinct way of specifying command line options.\n\nThe following features are supported in go-flags:\n\nAdditional features specific to Windows:\n\nThe flags package uses structs, reflection and struct field tags\nto allow users to specify command line options. This results in very simple\nand concise specification of your application options. For example:\n\nThis specifies one option with a short name -v and a long name --verbose.\nWhen either -v or --verbose is found on the command line, a 'true' value\nwill be appended to the Verbose field. e.g. when specifying -vvv, the\nresulting value of Verbose will be {[true, true, true]}.\n\nSlice options work exactly the same as primitive type options, except that\nwhenever the option is encountered, a value is appended to the slice.\n\nMap options from string to primitive type are also supported. On the command\nline, you specify the value for such an option as key:value. For example\n\nThen, the AuthorInfo map can be filled with something like\n-a name:Jesse -a \"surname:van den Kieboom\".\n\nFinally, for full control over the conversion between command line argument\nvalues and options, user defined types can choose to implement the Marshaler\nand Unmarshaler interfaces.\n\nThe following is a list of tags for struct fields supported by go-flags:\n\nEither the `short:` tag or the `long:` must be specified to make the field eligible as an\noption.\n\nOption groups are a simple way to semantically separate your options. All\noptions in a particular group are shown together in the help under the name\nof the group. Namespaces can be used to specify option long names more\nprecisely and emphasize the options affiliation to their group.\n\nThere are currently three ways to specify option groups.\n\nThe flags package also has basic support for commands. Commands are often\nused in monolithic applications that support various commands or actions.\nTake git for example, all of the add, commit, checkout, etc. are called\ncommands. Using commands you can easily separate multiple functions of your\napplication.\n\nThere are currently two ways to specify a command.\n\nThe most common, idiomatic way to implement commands is to define a global\nparser instance and implement each command in a separate file. These\ncommand files should define a go init function which calls AddCommand on\nthe global parser.\n\nWhen parsing ends and there is an active command and that command implements\nthe Commander interface, then its Execute method will be run with the\nremaining command line arguments.\n\nCommand structs can have options which become valid to parse after the\ncommand has been specified on the command line, in addition to the options\nof all the parent commands. I.e. considering a -v flag on the parser and an\nadd command, the following are equivalent:\n\nHowever, if the -v flag is defined on the add command, then the first of\nthe two examples above would fail since the -v flag is not defined before\nthe add command.\n\ngo-flags has builtin support to provide bash completion of flags, commands\nand argument values. To use completion, the binary which uses go-flags\ncan be invoked in a special environment to list completion of the current\ncommand line argument. It should be noted that this `executes` your application,\nand it is up to the user to make sure there are no negative side effects (for\nexample from init functions).\n\nSetting the environment variable `GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION=1` enables completion\nby replacing the argument parsing routine with the completion routine which\noutputs completions for the passed arguments. The basic invocation to\ncomplete a set of arguments is therefore:\n\nwhere `completion-example` is the binary, `arg1` and `arg2` are\nthe current arguments, and `arg3` (the last argument) is the argument\nto be completed. If the GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set to \"verbose\", then\ndescriptions of possible completion items will also be shown, if there\nare more than 1 completion items.\n\nTo use this with bash completion, a simple file can be written which\ncalls the binary which supports go-flags completion:\n\nCompletion requires the parser option PassDoubleDash and is therefore enforced if the environment variable GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set.\n\nCustomized completion for argument values is supported by implementing\nthe flags.Completer interface for the argument value type. An example\nof a type which does so is the flags.Filename type, an alias of string\nallowing simple filename completion. A slice or array argument value\nwhose element type implements flags.Completer will also be completed.",

The errors package allows\nprogrammers to add context to the failure path in their code in a way\nthat does not destroy the original value of the error.\n\nThe errors.Wrap function returns a new error that adds context to the\noriginal error by recording a stack trace at the point Wrap is called,\ntogether with the supplied message. For example\n\nIf additional control is required, the errors.WithStack and\nerrors.WithMessage functions destructure errors.Wrap into its component\noperations: annotating an error with a stack trace and with a message,\nrespectively.\n\nUsing errors.Wrap constructs a stack of errors, adding context to the\npreceding error. Depending on the nature of the error it may be necessary\nto reverse the operation of errors.Wrap to retrieve the original error\nfor inspection. Any error value which implements this interface\n\ncan be inspected by errors.Cause. errors.Cause will recursively retrieve\nthe topmost error that does not implement causer, which is assumed to be\nthe original cause. For example:\n\nAlthough the causer interface is not exported by this package, it is\nconsidered a part of its stable public interface.\n\nAll error values returned from this package implement fmt.Formatter and can\nbe formatted by the fmt package. The following verbs are supported:\n\nNew, Errorf, Wrap, and Wrapf record a stack trace at the point they are\ninvoked. This information can be retrieved with the following interface:\n\nThe returned errors.StackTrace type is defined as\n\nThe Frame type represents a call site in the stack trace.

The block format is the Decode and Encode\nfunctions and the stream format is the Reader and Writer types.\n\nThe block format, the more common case, is used when the complete size (the\nnumber of bytes) of the original data is known upfront, at the time\ncompression starts. The stream format, also known as the framing format, is\nfor when that isn't always true.\n\nThe canonical, C++ implementation is at https://github.com/google/snappy and\nit only implements the block format.",

      "description": "Package flags provides an extensive command line option parser.\nThe flags package is similar in functionality to the go built-in flag package\nbut provides more options and uses reflection to provide a convenient and\nsuccinct way of specifying command line options.\n\nThe following features are supported in go-flags:\n\nAdditional features specific to Windows:\n\nThe flags package uses structs, reflection and struct field tags\nto allow users to specify command line options. This results in very simple\nand concise specification of your application options. For example:\n\nThis specifies one option with a short name -v and a long name --verbose.\nWhen either -v or --verbose is found on the command line, a 'true' value\nwill be appended to the Verbose field. e.g. when specifying -vvv, the\nresulting value of Verbose will be {[true, true, true]}.\n\nSlice options work exactly the same as primitive type options, except that\nwhenever the option is encountered, a value is appended to the slice.\n\nMap options from string to primitive type are also supported. On the command\nline, you specify the value for such an option as key:value. For example\n\nThen, the AuthorInfo map can be filled with something like\n-a name:Jesse -a \"surname:van den Kieboom\".\n\nFinally, for full control over the conversion between command line argument\nvalues and options, user defined types can choose to implement the Marshaler\nand Unmarshaler interfaces.\n\nThe following is a list of tags for struct fields supported by go-flags:\n\nEither the `short:` tag or the `long:` must be specified to make the field eligible as an\noption.\n\nOption groups are a simple way to semantically separate your options. All\noptions in a particular group are shown together in the help under the name\nof the group. Namespaces can be used to specify option long names more\nprecisely and emphasize the options affiliation to their group.\n\nThere are currently three ways to specify option groups.\n\nThe flags package also has basic support for commands. Commands are often\nused in monolithic applications that support various commands or actions.\nTake git for example, all of the add, commit, checkout, etc. are called\ncommands. Using commands you can easily separate multiple functions of your\napplication.\n\nThere are currently two ways to specify a command.\n\nThe most common, idiomatic way to implement commands is to define a global\nparser instance and implement each command in a separate file. These\ncommand files should define a go init function which calls AddCommand on\nthe global parser.\n\nWhen parsing ends and there is an active command and that command implements\nthe Commander interface, then its Execute method will be run with the\nremaining command line arguments.\n\nCommand structs can have options which become valid to parse after the\ncommand has been specified on the command line, in addition to the options\nof all the parent commands. I.e. considering a -v flag on the parser and an\nadd command, the following are equivalent:\n\nHowever, if the -v flag is defined on the add command, then the first of\nthe two examples above would fail since the -v flag is not defined before\nthe add command.\n\ngo-flags has builtin support to provide bash completion of flags, commands\nand argument values. To use completion, the binary which uses go-flags\ncan be invoked in a special environment to list completion of the current\ncommand line argument. It should be noted that this `executes` your application,\nand it is up to the user to make sure there are no negative side effects (for\nexample from init functions).\n\nSetting the environment variable `GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION=1` enables completion\nby replacing the argument parsing routine with the completion routine which\noutputs completions for the passed arguments. The basic invocation to\ncomplete a set of arguments is therefore:\n\nwhere `completion-example` is the binary, `arg1` and `arg2` are\nthe current arguments, and `arg3` (the last argument) is the argument\nto be completed. If the GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set to \"verbose\", then\ndescriptions of possible completion items will also be shown, if there\nare more than 1 completion items.\n\nTo use this with bash completion, a simple file can be written which\ncalls the binary which supports go-flags completion:\n\nCompletion requires the parser option PassDoubleDash and is therefore enforced if the environment variable GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set.\n\nCustomized completion for argument values is supported by implementing\nthe flags.Completer interface for the argument value type. An example\nof a type which does so is the flags.Filename type, an alias of string\nallowing simple filename completion. A slice or array argument value\nwhose element type implements flags.Completer will also be completed.",

      "description": "Package azcore implements an HTTP request/response middleware pipeline used by Azure SDK clients.\n\nThe middleware consists of three components.\n\nA Policy can be implemented in two ways; as a first-class function for a stateless Policy, or as\na method on a type for a stateful Policy.  Note that HTTP requests made via the same pipeline share\nthe same Policy instances, so if a Policy mutates its state it MUST be properly synchronized to\navoid race conditions.\n\nA Policy's Do method is called when an HTTP request wants to be sent over the network. The Do method can\nperform any operation(s) it desires. For example, it can log the outgoing request, mutate the URL, headers,\nand/or query parameters, inject a failure, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its request\nwork, it must call the Next() method on the *policy.Request instance in order to pass the request to the\nnext Policy in the chain.\n\nWhen an HTTP response comes back, the Policy then gets a chance to process the response/error.  The Policy instance\ncan log the response, retry the operation if it failed due to a transient error or timeout, unmarshal the response\nbody, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its response work, it must return the *http.Response\nand error instances to its caller.\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateless Policy:\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateful Policy:\n\nThe Transporter interface is responsible for sending the HTTP request and returning the corresponding\nHTTP response or error.  The Transporter is invoked by the last Policy in the chain.  The default Transporter\nimplementation uses a shared http.Client from the standard library.\n\nThe same stateful/stateless rules for Policy implementations apply to Transporter implementations.\n\nTo use the Policy and Transporter instances, an application passes them to the runtime.NewPipeline function.\n\nThe specified Policy instances form a chain and are invoked in the order provided to NewPipeline\nfollowed by the Transporter.\n\nOnce the Pipeline has been created, create a runtime.Request instance and pass it to Pipeline's Do method.\n\nThe Pipeline.Do method sends the specified Request through the chain of Policy and Transporter\ninstances.  The response/error is then sent through the same chain of Policy instances in reverse\norder.  For example, assuming there are Policy types PolicyA, PolicyB, and PolicyC along with\nTransportA.\n\nThe flow of Request and Response looks like the following:\n\nThe Request instance passed to Pipeline's Do method is a wrapper around an *http.Request.  It also\ncontains some internal state and provides various convenience methods.  You create a Request instance\nby calling the runtime.NewRequest function:\n\nIf the Request should contain a body, call the SetBody method.\n\nA seekable stream is required so that upon retry, the retry Policy instance can seek the stream\nback to the beginning before retrying the network request and re-uploading the body.\n\nOperations like JSON-MERGE-PATCH send a JSON null to indicate a value should be deleted.\n\nThis requirement conflicts with the SDK's default marshalling that specifies \"omitempty\" as\na means to resolve the ambiguity between a field to be excluded and its zero-value.\n\nIn the above example, Name and Count are defined as pointer-to-type to disambiguate between\na missing value (nil) and a zero-value (0) which might have semantic differences.\n\nIn a PATCH operation, any fields left as nil are to have their values preserved.  When updating\na Widget's count, one simply specifies the new value for Count, leaving Name nil.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement for sending a JSON null, the NullValue() function can be used.\n\nThis sends an explict \"null\" for Count, indicating that any current value for Count should be deleted.\n\nWhen the HTTP response is received, the *http.Response is returned directly. Each Policy instance\ncan inspect/mutate the *http.Response.\n\nTo enable logging, set environment variable AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING to \"all\" before executing your program.\n\nBy default the logger writes to stderr.  This can be customized by calling log.SetListener, providing\na callback that writes to the desired location.  Any custom logging implementation MUST provide its\nown synchronization to handle concurrent invocations.\n\nSee the docs for the log package for further details.\n\nPageable operations return potentially large data sets spread over multiple GET requests.  The result of\neach GET is a \"page\" of data consisting of a slice of items.\n\nPageable operations can be identified by their New*Pager naming convention and return type of *runtime.Pager[T].\n\nThe call to WidgetClient.NewListWidgetsPager() returns an instance of *runtime.Pager[T] for fetching pages\nand determining if there are more pages to fetch.  No IO calls are made until the NextPage() method is invoked.\n\nLong-running operations (LROs) are operations consisting of an initial request to start the operation followed\nby polling to determine when the operation has reached a terminal state.  An LRO's terminal state is one\nof the following values.\n\nLROs can be identified by their Begin* prefix and their return type of *runtime.Poller[T].\n\nWhen a call to WidgetClient.BeginCreateOrUpdate() returns a nil error, it means that the LRO has started.\nIt does _not_ mean that the widget has been created or updated (or failed to be created/updated).\n\nThe *runtime.Poller[T] provides APIs for determining the state of the LRO.  To wait for the LRO to complete,\ncall the PollUntilDone() method.\n\nThe call to PollUntilDone() will block the current goroutine until the LRO has reached a terminal state or the\ncontext is canceled/timed out.\n\nNote that LROs can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  The duration is operation-dependent.  Due to\nthis variant behavior, pollers do _not_ have a preconfigured time-out.  Use a context with the appropriate cancellation\nmechanism as required.\n\nPollers provide the ability to serialize their state into a \"resume token\" which can be used by another process to\nrecreate the poller.  This is achieved via the runtime.Poller[T].ResumeToken() method.\n\nNote that a token can only be obtained for a poller that's in a non-terminal state.  Also note that any subsequent calls\nto poller.Poll() might change the poller's state.  In this case, a new token should be created.\n\nAfter the token has been obtained, it can be used to recreate an instance of the originating poller.\n\nWhen resuming a poller, no IO is performed, and zero-value arguments can be used for everything but the Options.ResumeToken.\n\nResume tokens are unique per service client and operation.  Attempting to resume a poller for LRO BeginB() with a token from LRO\nBeginA() will result in an error.\n\nThe fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.\nThis allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.\n\nPlease see https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/samples/fakes for details and examples on how to use fakes.",
