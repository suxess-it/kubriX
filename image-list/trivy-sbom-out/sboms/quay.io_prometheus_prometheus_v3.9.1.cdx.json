Packages in the Go ecosystem can depend on this package,\nwhile callers can implement logging with whatever backend is appropriate.\n\nLogging is done using a Logger instance.  Logger is a concrete type with\nmethods, which defers the actual logging to a LogSink interface.  The main\nmethods of Logger are Info() and Error().  Arguments to Info() and Error()\nare key/value pairs rather than printf-style formatted strings, emphasizing\n\"structured logging\".\n\nWith Go's standard log package, we might write:\n\nWith logr's structured logging, we'd write:\n\nErrors are much the same.  Instead of:\n\nWe'd write:\n\nInfo() and Error() are very similar, but they are separate methods so that\nLogSink implementations can choose to do things like attach additional\ninformation (such as stack traces) on calls to Error(). Error() messages are\nalways logged, regardless of the current verbosity.  If there is no error\ninstance available, passing nil is valid.\n\nOften we want to log information only when the application in \"verbose\nmode\".  To write log lines that are more verbose, Logger has a V() method.\nThe higher the V-level of a log line, the less critical it is considered.\nLog-lines with V-levels that are not enabled (as per the LogSink) will not\nbe written.  Level V(0) is the default, and logger.V(0).Info() has the same\nmeaning as logger.Info().  Negative V-levels have the same meaning as V(0).\nError messages do not have a verbosity level and are always logged.\n\nWhere we might have written:\n\nWe can write:\n\nLogger instances can have name strings so that all messages logged through\nthat instance have additional context.  For example, you might want to add\na subsystem name:\n\nThe WithName() method returns a new Logger, which can be passed to\nconstructors or other functions for further use.  Repeated use of WithName()\nwill accumulate name \"segments\".  These name segments will be joined in some\nway by the LogSink implementation.  It is strongly recommended that name\nsegments contain simple identifiers (letters, digits, and hyphen), and do\nnot contain characters that could muddle the log output or confuse the\njoining operation (e.g. whitespace, commas, periods, slashes, brackets,\nquotes, etc).\n\nLogger instances can store any number of key/value pairs, which will be\nlogged alongside all messages logged through that instance.  For example,\nyou might want to create a Logger instance per managed object:\n\nWith the standard log package, we might write:\n\nWith logr we'd write:\n\nLogger has very few hard rules, with the goal that LogSink implementations\nmight have a lot of freedom to differentiate.  There are, however, some\nthings to consider.\n\nThe log message consists of a constant message attached to the log line.\nThis should generally be a simple description of what's occurring, and should\nnever be a format string.  Variable information can then be attached using\nnamed values.\n\nKeys are arbitrary strings, but should generally be constant values.  Values\nmay be any Go value, but how the value is formatted is determined by the\nLogSink implementation.\n\nLogger instances are meant to be passed around by value. Code that receives\nsuch a value can call its methods without having to check whether the\ninstance is ready for use.\n\nThe zero logger (= Logger{}) is identical to Discard() and discards all log\nentries. Code that receives a Logger by value can simply call it, the methods\nwill never crash. For cases where passing a logger is optional, a pointer to Logger\nshould be used.\n\nKeys are not strictly required to conform to any specification or regex, but\nit is recommended that they:\n\nThese guidelines help ensure that log data is processed properly regardless\nof the log implementation.  For example, log implementations will try to\noutput JSON data or will store data for later database (e.g. SQL) queries.\n\nWhile users are generally free to use key names of their choice, it's\ngenerally best to avoid using the following keys, as they're frequently used\nby implementations:\n\nImplementations are encouraged to make use of these keys to represent the\nabove concepts, when necessary (for example, in a pure-JSON output form, it\nwould be necessary to represent at least message and timestamp as ordinary\nnamed values).\n\nImplementations may choose to give callers access to the underlying\nlogging implementation.  The recommended pattern for this is:\n\nLogger grants access to the sink to enable type assertions like this:\n\nCustom `With*` functions can be implemented by copying the complete\nLogger struct and replacing the sink in the copy:\n\nDon't use New to construct a new Logger with a LogSink retrieved from an\nexisting Logger. Source code attribution might not work correctly and\nunexported fields in Logger get lost.\n\nBeware that the same LogSink instance may be shared by different logger\ninstances. Calling functions that modify the LogSink will affect all of\nthose.","licenses":[{"expression":"(Apache-2.0)"}],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/go-logr/logr@v1.4.3","externalReferences":[{"url":"https://github.com/go-logr/logr","type":"website"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-logr/logr","type":"distribution"},{"url":"https://github.com/go-logr/logr","type":"vcs"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-logr/logr#section-documentation","type":"documentation"}],"properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:6888b9d06e43a6f48204bacf65857d5f40325b0609ed22a5a2dcd8e849c74753"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:3dccafa3f67b159c6c51d6206d93d8ce98af27ac554918b926adc366bdaddf55"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"github.com/go-logr/logr@v1.4.3"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"},{"name":"ecosystems:first_release_published_at","value":"2018-06-29T23:58:05Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:latest_release_published_at","value":"2025-05-19T04:56:57Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"logger"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"logging"}]},{"bom-ref":"00d533c0-b8d4-456d-80b7-c4b207d7d542","type":"library","name":"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/lightsail","version":"v1.50.10","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/lightsail@v1.50.10","properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:6888b9d06e43a6f48204bacf65857d5f40325b0609ed22a5a2dcd8e849c74753"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:3dccafa3f67b159c6c51d6206d93d8ce98af27ac554918b926adc366bdaddf55"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/lightsail@v1.50.10"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"}]},{"bom-ref":"01c1f7e2-d202-48ca-857e-cc8e97960536","type":"library","supplier":{"name":"Microsoft Azure","url":["https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/"]},"author":"Microsoft Azure","name":"github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azcore","version":"v1.20.0","description":"Package azcore implements an HTTP request/response middleware pipeline used by Azure SDK clients.\n\nThe middleware consists of three components.\n\nA Policy can be implemented in two ways; as a first-class function for a stateless Policy, or as\na method on a type for a stateful Policy.  Note that HTTP requests made via the same pipeline share\nthe same Policy instances, so if a Policy mutates its state it MUST be properly synchronized to\navoid race conditions.\n\nA Policy's Do method is called when an HTTP request wants to be sent over the network. The Do method can\nperform any operation(s) it desires. For example, it can log the outgoing request, mutate the URL, headers,\nand/or query parameters, inject a failure, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its request\nwork, it must call the Next() method on the *policy.Request instance in order to pass the request to the\nnext Policy in the chain.\n\nWhen an HTTP response comes back, the Policy then gets a chance to process the response/error.  The Policy instance\ncan log the response, retry the operation if it failed due to a transient error or timeout, unmarshal the response\nbody, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its response work, it must return the *http.Response\nand error instances to its caller.\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateless Policy:\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateful Policy:\n\nThe Transporter interface is responsible for sending the HTTP request and returning the corresponding\nHTTP response or error.  The Transporter is invoked by the last Policy in the chain.  The default Transporter\nimplementation uses a shared http.Client from the standard library.\n\nThe same stateful/stateless rules for Policy implementations apply to Transporter implementations.\n\nTo use the Policy and Transporter instances, an application passes them to the runtime.NewPipeline function.\n\nThe specified Policy instances form a chain and are invoked in the order provided to NewPipeline\nfollowed by the Transporter.\n\nOnce the Pipeline has been created, create a runtime.Request instance and pass it to Pipeline's Do method.\n\nThe Pipeline.Do method sends the specified Request through the chain of Policy and Transporter\ninstances.  The response/error is then sent through the same chain of Policy instances in reverse\norder.  For example, assuming there are Policy types PolicyA, PolicyB, and PolicyC along with\nTransportA.\n\nThe flow of Request and Response looks like the following:\n\nThe Request instance passed to Pipeline's Do method is a wrapper around an *http.Request.  It also\ncontains some internal state and provides various convenience methods.  You create a Request instance\nby calling the runtime.NewRequest function:\n\nIf the Request should contain a body, call the SetBody method.\n\nA seekable stream is required so that upon retry, the retry Policy instance can seek the stream\nback to the beginning before retrying the network request and re-uploading the body.\n\nOperations like JSON-MERGE-PATCH send a JSON null to indicate a value should be deleted.\n\nThis requirement conflicts with the SDK's default marshalling that specifies \"omitempty\" as\na means to resolve the ambiguity between a field to be excluded and its zero-value.\n\nIn the above example, Name and Count are defined as pointer-to-type to disambiguate between\na missing value (nil) and a zero-value (0) which might have semantic differences.\n\nIn a PATCH operation, any fields left as nil are to have their values preserved.  When updating\na Widget's count, one simply specifies the new value for Count, leaving Name nil.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement for sending a JSON null, the NullValue() function can be used.\n\nThis sends an explict \"null\" for Count, indicating that any current value for Count should be deleted.\n\nWhen the HTTP response is received, the *http.Response is returned directly. Each Policy instance\ncan inspect/mutate the *http.Response.\n\nTo enable logging, set environment variable AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING to \"all\" before executing your program.\n\nBy default the logger writes to stderr.  This can be customized by calling log.SetListener, providing\na callback that writes to the desired location.  Any custom logging implementation MUST provide its\nown synchronization to handle concurrent invocations.\n\nSee the docs for the log package for further details.\n\nPageable operations return potentially large data sets spread over multiple GET requests.  The result of\neach GET is a \"page\" of data consisting of a slice of items.\n\nPageable operations can be identified by their New*Pager naming convention and return type of *runtime.Pager[T].\n\nThe call to WidgetClient.NewListWidgetsPager() returns an instance of *runtime.Pager[T] for fetching pages\nand determining if there are more pages to fetch.  No IO calls are made until the NextPage() method is invoked.\n\nLong-running operations (LROs) are operations consisting of an initial request to start the operation followed\nby polling to determine when the operation has reached a terminal state.  An LRO's terminal state is one\nof the following values.\n\nLROs can be identified by their Begin* prefix and their return type of *runtime.Poller[T].\n\nWhen a call to WidgetClient.BeginCreateOrUpdate() returns a nil error, it means that the LRO has started.\nIt does _not_ mean that the widget has been created or updated (or failed to be created/updated).\n\nThe *runtime.Poller[T] provides APIs for determining the state of the LRO.  To wait for the LRO to complete,\ncall the PollUntilDone() method.\n\nThe call to PollUntilDone() will block the current goroutine until the LRO has reached a terminal state or the\ncontext is canceled/timed out.\n\nNote that LROs can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  The duration is operation-dependent.  Due to\nthis variant behavior, pollers do _not_ have a preconfigured time-out.  Use a context with the appropriate cancellation\nmechanism as required.\n\nPollers provide the ability to serialize their state into a \"resume token\" which can be used by another process to\nrecreate the poller.  This is achieved via the runtime.Poller[T].ResumeToken() method.\n\nNote that a token can only be obtained for a poller that's in a non-terminal state.  Also note that any subsequent calls\nto poller.Poll() might change the poller's state.  In this case, a new token should be created.\n\nAfter the token has been obtained, it can be used to recreate an instance of the originating poller.\n\nWhen resuming a poller, no IO is performed, and zero-value arguments can be used for everything but the Options.ResumeToken.\n\nResume tokens are unique per service client and operation.  Attempting to resume a poller for LRO BeginB() with a token from LRO\nBeginA() will result in an error.\n\nThe fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.\nThis allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.\n\nPlease see

For example, if a struct has a field\n\"Username\" then mapstructure will look for a key in the source value\nof \"username\" (case insensitive).\n\nYou can change the behavior of mapstructure by using struct tags.\nThe default struct tag that mapstructure looks for is \"mapstructure\"\nbut you can customize it using DecoderConfig.\n\nTo rename the key that mapstructure looks for, use the \"mapstructure\"\ntag and set a value directly. For example, to change the \"username\" example\nabove to \"user\":\n\nEmbedded structs are treated as if they're another field with that name.\nBy default, the two structs below are equivalent when decoding with\nmapstructure:\n\nThis would require an input that looks like below:\n\nIf your \"person\" value is NOT nested, then you can append \",squash\" to\nyour tag value and mapstructure will treat it as if the embedded struct\nwere part of the struct directly. Example:\n\nNow the following input would be accepted:\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to a map, the squash tag squashes the struct\nfields into a single map. Using the example structs from above:\n\nWill be decoded into a map:\n\nDecoderConfig has a field that changes the behavior of mapstructure\nto always squash embedded structs.\n\nIf there are any unmapped keys in the source value, mapstructure by\ndefault will silently ignore them. You can error by setting ErrorUnused\nin DecoderConfig. If you're using Metadata you can also maintain a slice\nof the unused keys.\n\nYou can also use the \",remain\" suffix on your tag to collect all unused\nvalues in a map. The field with this tag MUST be a map type and should\nprobably be a \"map[string]any\" or \"map[any]any\".\nSee example below:\n\nGiven the input below, Other would be populated with the other\nvalues that weren't used (everything but \"name\"):\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to any other value, you may use the\n\",omitempty\" suffix on your tag to omit that value if it equates to\nthe zero value, or a zero-length element. The zero value of all types is\nspecified in the Go specification.\n\nFor example, the zero type of a numeric type is zero (\"0\"). If the struct\nfield value is zero and a numeric type, the field is empty, and it won't\nbe encoded into the destination type. And likewise for the URLs field, if the\nslice is nil or empty, it won't be encoded into the destination type.\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to any other value, you may use the\n\",omitzero\" suffix on your tag to omit that value if it equates to the zero\nvalue. The zero value of all types is specified in the Go specification.\n\nFor example, the zero type of a numeric type is zero (\"0\"). If the struct\nfield value is zero and a numeric type, the field is empty, and it won't\nbe encoded into the destination type. And likewise for the URLs field, if the\nslice is nil, it won't be encoded into the destination type.\n\nNote that if the field is a slice, and it is empty but not nil, it will\nstill be encoded into the destination type.\n\nSince unexported (private) struct fields cannot be set outside the package\nwhere they are defined, the decoder will simply skip them.\n\nFor this output type definition:\n\nUsing this map as input:\n\nThe following struct will be decoded:\n\nTypes can implement the Unmarshaler interface to control their own decoding. The interface\nbehaves similarly to how UnmarshalJSON does in the standard library. It can be used as an\nalternative or companion to a DecodeHook.\n\nSee the Unmarshaler interface documentation for more details.\n\nmapstructure is highly configurable.

A server application calls\nthe Upgrader.Upgrade method from an HTTP request handler to get a *Conn:\n\nCall the connection's WriteMessage and ReadMessage methods to send and\nreceive messages as a slice of bytes. This snippet of code shows how to echo\nmessages using these methods:\n\nIn above snippet of code, p is a []byte and messageType is an int with value\nwebsocket.BinaryMessage or websocket.TextMessage.\n\nAn application can also send and receive messages using the io.WriteCloser\nand io.Reader interfaces. To send a message, call the connection NextWriter\nmethod to get an io.WriteCloser, write the message to the writer and close\nthe writer when done. To receive a message, call the connection NextReader\nmethod to get an io.Reader and read until io.EOF is returned. This snippet\nshows how to echo messages using the NextWriter and NextReader methods:\n\nThe WebSocket protocol distinguishes between text and binary data messages.\nText messages are interpreted as UTF-8 encoded text. The interpretation of\nbinary messages is left to the application.\n\nThis package uses the TextMessage and BinaryMessage integer constants to\nidentify the two data message types. The ReadMessage and NextReader methods\nreturn the type of the received message. The messageType argument to the\nWriteMessage and NextWriter methods specifies the type of a sent message.\n\nIt is the application's responsibility to ensure that text messages are\nvalid UTF-8 encoded text.\n\nThe WebSocket protocol defines three types of control messages: close, ping\nand pong. Call the connection WriteControl, WriteMessage or NextWriter\nmethods to send a control message to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received close messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetCloseHandler method and by returning a *CloseError from the\nNextReader, ReadMessage or the message Read method. The default close\nhandler sends a close message to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received ping messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetPingHandler method. The default ping handler sends a pong\nmessage to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received pong messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetPongHandler method. The default pong handler does nothing.\nIf an application sends ping messages, then the application should set a\npong handler to receive the corresponding pong.\n\nThe control message handler functions are called from the NextReader,\nReadMessage and message reader Read methods. The default close and ping\nhandlers can block these methods for a short time when the handler writes to\nthe connection.\n\nThe application must read the connection to process close, ping and pong\nmessages sent from the peer. If the application is not otherwise interested\nin messages from the peer, then the application should start a goroutine to\nread and discard messages from the peer. A simple example is:\n\nConnections support one concurrent reader and one concurrent writer.\n\nApplications are responsible for ensuring that no more than one goroutine\ncalls the write methods (NextWriter, SetWriteDeadline, WriteMessage,\nWriteJSON, EnableWriteCompression, SetCompressionLevel) concurrently and\nthat no more than one goroutine calls the read methods (NextReader,\nSetReadDeadline, ReadMessage, ReadJSON, SetPongHandler, SetPingHandler)\nconcurrently.\n\nThe Close and WriteControl methods can be called concurrently with all other\nmethods.\n\nWeb browsers allow Javascript applications to open a WebSocket connection to\nany host. It's up to the server to enforce an origin policy using the Origin\nrequest header sent by the browser.\n\nThe Upgrader calls the function specified in the CheckOrigin field to check\nthe origin. If the CheckOrigin function returns false, then the Upgrade\nmethod fails the WebSocket handshake with HTTP status 403.\n\nIf the CheckOrigin field is nil, then the Upgrader uses a safe default: fail\nthe handshake if the Origin request header is present and the Origin host is\nnot equal to the Host request header.\n\nThe deprecated package-level Upgrade function does not perform origin\nchecking. The application is responsible for checking the Origin header\nbefore calling the Upgrade function.\n\nConnections buffer network input and output to reduce the number\nof system calls when reading or writing messages.\n\nWrite buffers are also used for constructing WebSocket frames. See RFC 6455,\nSection 5 for a discussion of message framing. A WebSocket frame header is\nwritten to the network each time a write buffer is flushed to the network.\nDecreasing the size of the write buffer can increase the amount of framing\noverhead on the connection.\n\nThe buffer sizes in bytes are specified by the ReadBufferSize and\nWriteBufferSize fields in the Dialer and Upgrader. The Dialer uses a default\nsize of 4096 when a buffer size field is set to zero. The Upgrader reuses\nbuffers created by the HTTP server when a buffer size field is set to zero.\nThe HTTP server buffers have a size of 4096 at the time of this writing.\n\nThe buffer sizes do not limit the size of a message that can be read or\nwritten by a connection.\n\nBuffers are held for the lifetime of the connection by default. If the\nDialer or Upgrader WriteBufferPool field is set, then a connection holds the\nwrite buffer only when writing a message.\n\nApplications should tune the buffer sizes to balance memory use and\nperformance. Increasing the buffer size uses more memory, but can reduce the\nnumber of system calls to read or write the network. In the case of writing,\nincreasing the buffer size can reduce the number of frame headers written to\nthe network.\n\nSome guidelines for setting buffer parameters are:\n\nLimit the buffer sizes to the maximum expected message size. Buffers larger\nthan the largest message do not provide any benefit.\n\nDepending on the distribution of message sizes, setting the buffer size to\na value less than the maximum expected message size can greatly reduce memory\nuse with a small impact on performance. Here's an example: If 99% of the\nmessages are smaller than 256 bytes and the maximum message size is 512\nbytes, then a buffer size of 256 bytes will result in 1.01 more system calls\nthan a buffer size of 512 bytes. The memory savings is 50%.\n\nA write buffer pool is useful when the application has a modest number\nwrites over a large number of connections. when buffers are pooled, a larger\nbuffer size has a reduced impact on total memory use and has the benefit of\nreducing system calls and frame overhead.\n\nPer message compression extensions (RFC 7692) are experimentally supported\nby this package in a limited capacity. Setting the EnableCompression option\nto true in Dialer or Upgrader will attempt to negotiate per message deflate\nsupport.\n\nIf compression was successfully negotiated with the connection's peer, any\nmessage received in compressed form will be automatically decompressed.\nAll Read methods will return uncompressed bytes.\n\nPer message compression of messages written to a connection can be enabled\nor disabled by calling the corresponding Conn method:\n\nCurrently this package does not support compression with \"context takeover\".\nThis means that messages must be compressed and decompressed in isolation,\nwithout retaining sliding window or dictionary state across messages. For\nmore details refer to RFC 7692.\n\nUse of compression is experimental and may result in decreased performance.","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/gorilla/websocket@v1.5.4-0.20250319132907-e064f32e3674","externalReferences":[{"url":"https://github.com/gorilla/websocket","type":"website"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/websocket","type":"distribution"},{"url":"https://github.com/gorilla/websocket","type":"vcs"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/websocket#section-documentation","type":"documentation"}],"properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:be504ffc809244f987d79757ccfa917313bd387192992494527bc745e8c05819"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:d956c9c5fe9e14a48e6d73ac97cea3df120fffbdb1219c77991ec45d76a41ef5"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"github.com/gorilla/websocket@v1.5.4-0.20250319132907-e064f32e3674"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"},{"name":"ecosystems:first_release_published_at","value":"2016-04-28T16:34:18Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:latest_release_published_at","value":"2024-06-14T03:18:03Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:owner_location","value":"The World"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"go"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"golang"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"gorilla"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"gorilla-web-toolkit"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"websocket"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"websockets"}]},{"bom-ref":"16df3e68-a744-48ee-be1e-33c6be333115","type":"library","supplier":{"name":"OpenTelemetry - CNCF","url":["https://opentelemetry.io"]},"author":"OpenTelemetry - CNCF","name":"go.opentelemetry.io/auto/sdk","version":"v1.2.1","description":"Package sdk provides an auto-instrumentable OpenTelemetry SDK.\n\nAn go.opentelemetry.io/auto.Instrumentation can be configured to target the\nprocess running this SDK.

Micklei","url":["https://ernestmicklei.com"]},"author":"Ernest Micklei","name":"github.com/emicklei/go-restful/v3","version":"v3.12.2","description":"Package restful , a lean package for creating REST-style WebServices without magic.\n\n### WebServices and Routes\n\nA WebService has a collection of Route objects that dispatch incoming Http Requests to a function calls.\nTypically, a WebService has a root path (e.g. /users) and defines common MIME types for its routes.\nWebServices must be added to a container (see below) in order to handler Http requests from a server.\n\nA Route is defined by a HTTP method, an URL path and (optionally) the MIME types it consumes (Content-Type) and produces (Accept).\nThis package has the logic to find the best matching Route and if found, call its Function.\n\nThe (*Request, *Response) arguments provide functions for reading information from the request and writing information back to the response.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/user-resource/restful-user-resource.go with a full implementation.\n\n### Regular expression matching Routes\n\nA Route parameter can be specified using the format \"uri/{var[:regexp]}\" or the special version \"uri/{var:*}\" for matching the tail of the path.\nFor example, /persons/{name:[A-Z][A-Z]} can be used to restrict values for the parameter \"name\" to only contain capital alphabetic characters.\nRegular expressions must use the standard Go syntax as described in the regexp package. (https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax)\nThis feature requires the use of a CurlyRouter.\n\n### Containers\n\nA Container holds a collection of WebServices, Filters and a http.ServeMux for multiplexing http requests.\nUsing the statements \"restful.Add(...) and restful.Filter(...)\" will register WebServices and Filters to the Default Container.\nThe Default container of go-restful uses the http.DefaultServeMux.\nYou can create your own Container and create a new http.Server for that particular container.\n\n### Filters\n\nA filter dynamically intercepts requests and responses to transform or use the information contained in the requests or responses.\nYou can use filters to perform generic logging, measurement, authentication, redirect, set response headers etc.\nIn the restful package there are three hooks into the request,response flow where filters can be added.\nEach filter must define a FilterFunction:\n\nUse the following statement to pass the request,response pair to the next filter or RouteFunction\n\n### Container Filters\n\nThese are processed before any registered WebService.\n\n### WebService Filters\n\nThese are processed before any Route of a WebService.\n\n### Route Filters\n\nThese are processed before calling the function associated with the Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/filters/restful-filters.go with full implementations.\n\n### Response Encoding\n\nTwo encodings are supported: gzip and deflate. To enable this for all responses:\n\nIf a Http request includes the Accept-Encoding header then the response content will be compressed using the specified encoding.\nAlternatively, you can create a Filter that performs the encoding and install it per WebService or Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/encoding/restful-encoding-filter.go\n\n### OPTIONS support\n\nBy installing a pre-defined container filter, your Webservice(s) can respond to the OPTIONS Http request.\n\n### CORS\n\nBy installing the filter of a CrossOriginResourceSharing (CORS), your WebService(s) can handle CORS requests.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nUnexpected things happen. If a request cannot be processed because of a failure, your service needs to tell via the response what happened and why.\nFor this reason HTTP status codes exist and it is important to use the correct code in every exceptional situation.\n\nIf path or query parameters are not valid (content or type) then use http.StatusBadRequest.\n\nDespite a valid URI, the resource requested may not be available\n\nIf the application logic could not process the request (or write the response) then use http.StatusInternalServerError.\n\nThe request has a valid URL but the method (GET,PUT,POST,...) is not allowed.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Accept Header set for this operation.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Content-Type Header set for this operation.\n\n### ServiceError\n\nIn addition to setting the correct (error) Http status code, you can choose to write a ServiceError message on the response.\n\n### Performance options\n\nThis package has several options that affect the performance of your service. It is important to understand them and how you can change it.\n\nDoNotRecover controls whether panics will be caught to return HTTP 500.\nIf set to false, the container will recover from panics.\nDefault value is true\n\nIf content encoding is enabled then the default strategy for getting new gzip/zlib writers and readers is to use a sync.Pool.\nBecause writers are expensive structures, performance is even more improved when using a preloaded cache. You can also inject your own implementation.\n\n### Trouble shooting\n\nThis package has the means to produce detail logging of the complete Http request matching process and filter invocation.\nEnabling this feature requires you to set an implementation of restful.StdLogger (e.g. log.Logger) instance such as:\n\n### Logging\n\nThe restful.SetLogger() method allows you to override the logger used by the package. By default restful\nuses the standard library `log` package and logs to stdout. Different logging packages are supported as\nlong as they conform to `StdLogger` interface defined in the `log` sub-package, writing an adapter for your\npreferred package is simple.\n\n### Resources\n\n(c) 2012-2025, http://ernestmicklei.com.

If you will be\nconnecting to the same hosts repeatedly from the same client, you can use\nDefaultPooledClient to receive a client that has connection pooling\nsemantics similar to http.DefaultClient.","licenses":[{"expression":"(MPL-2.0)"}],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/hashicorp/go-cleanhttp@v0.5.2","externalReferences":[{"url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/go-cleanhttp","type":"website"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/go-cleanhttp","type":"distribution"},{"url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/go-cleanhttp","type":"vcs"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/go-cleanhttp#section-documentation","type":"documentation"}],"properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:6888b9d06e43a6f48204bacf65857d5f40325b0609ed22a5a2dcd8e849c74753"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:3dccafa3f67b159c6c51d6206d93d8ce98af27ac554918b926adc366bdaddf55"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"github.com/hashicorp/go-cleanhttp@v0.5.2"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"},{"name":"ecosystems:first_release_published_at","value":"2018-08-30T03:37:06Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:latest_release_published_at","value":"2021-02-03T18:51:13Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:owner_location","value":"San Francisco, CA"}]},{"bom-ref":"1ad1b76e-02ed-41ba-a546-adb09e35b92d","type":"library","supplier":{"name":"Facette","url":["https://facette.io/"]},"author":"Facette","name":"github.com/facette/natsort","version":"v0.0.0-20181210072756-2cd4dd1e2dcb","description":"Package natsort implements natural strings sorting","licenses":[{"expression":"(BSD-3-Clause)"}],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/facette/natsort@v0.0.0-20181210072756-2cd4dd1e2dcb","externalReferences":[{"url":"https://github.com/facette/natsort","type":"website"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/facette/natsort","type":"distribution"},{"url":"https://github.com/facette/natsort","type":"vcs"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/facette/natsort#section-documentation","type":"documentation"}],"properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:be504ffc809244f987d79757ccfa917313bd387192992494527bc745e8c05819"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:d956c9c5fe9e14a48e6d73ac97cea3df120fffbdb1219c77991ec45d76a41ef5"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"github.com/facette/natsort@v0.0.0-20181210072756-2cd4dd1e2dcb"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"},{"name":"ecosystems:first_release_published_at","value":"2018-12-10T07:27:56Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:latest_release_published_at","value":"2018-12-10T07:27:56Z"}]},{"bom-ref":"1b23029c-ad32-4b32-9310-c0960d661d3a","type":"library","supplier":{"name":"OpenAPI Initiative golang toolkit"},"author":"OpenAPI Initiative golang toolkit","name":"github.com/go-openapi/swag/jsonutils","version":"v0.25.4","description":"Package jsonutils provides helpers to work with JSON.\n\nThese utilities work with dynamic go structures to and from JSON.","licenses":[{"expression":"(Apache-2.0)"}],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/go-openapi/swag/jsonutils@v0.25.4","externalReferences":[{"url":"https://github.com/go-openapi/swag","type":"website"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-openapi/swag/jsonutils","type":"distribution"},{"url":"https://github.com/go-openapi/swag","type":"vcs"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-openapi/swag/jsonutils#section-documentation","type":"documentation"}],"properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:be504ffc809244f987d79757ccfa917313bd387192992494527bc745e8c05819"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:d956c9c5fe9e14a48e6d73ac97cea3df120fffbdb1219c77991ec45d76a41ef5"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"github.com/go-openapi/swag/jsonutils@v0.25.4"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"},{"name":"ecosystems:first_release_published_at","value":"2025-08-30T09:41:09Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:latest_release_published_at","value":"2025-11-25T18:28:48Z"}]},{"bom-ref":"1b493aac-1e78-4e7c-bde0-082bbe7e9835","type":"library","supplier":{"name":"HashiCorp","url":["https://hashicorp.com"]},"author":"HashiCorp","name":"github.com/hashicorp/golang-lru","version":"v0.6.0","description":"Package lru provides three different LRU caches of varying sophistication.\n\nCache is a simple LRU cache.

mapstructure exposes functionality to convert one arbitrary\nGo type into another, typically to convert a map[string]any\ninto a native Go structure.\n\nThe Go structure can be arbitrarily complex, containing slices,\nother structs, etc. and the decoder will properly decode nested\nmaps and so on into the proper structures in the native Go struct.\nSee the examples to see what the decoder is capable of.\n\nThe simplest function to start with is Decode.\n\nWhen decoding to a struct, mapstructure will use the field name by\ndefault to perform the mapping. For example, if a struct has a field\n\"Username\" then mapstructure will look for a key in the source value\nof \"username\" (case insensitive).\n\nYou can change the behavior of mapstructure by using struct tags.\nThe default struct tag that mapstructure looks for is \"mapstructure\"\nbut you can customize it using DecoderConfig.\n\nTo rename the key that mapstructure looks for, use the \"mapstructure\"\ntag and set a value directly. For example, to change the \"username\" example\nabove to \"user\":\n\nEmbedded structs are treated as if they're another field with that name.\nBy default, the two structs below are equivalent when decoding with\nmapstructure:\n\nThis would require an input that looks like below:\n\nIf your \"person\" value is NOT nested, then you can append \",squash\" to\nyour tag value and mapstructure will treat it as if the embedded struct\nwere part of the struct directly. Example:\n\nNow the following input would be accepted:\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to a map, the squash tag squashes the struct\nfields into a single map. Using the example structs from above:\n\nWill be decoded into a map:\n\nDecoderConfig has a field that changes the behavior of mapstructure\nto always squash embedded structs.\n\nIf there are any unmapped keys in the source value, mapstructure by\ndefault will silently ignore them. You can error by setting ErrorUnused\nin DecoderConfig. If you're using Metadata you can also maintain a slice\nof the unused keys.\n\nYou can also use the \",remain\" suffix on your tag to collect all unused\nvalues in a map. The field with this tag MUST be a map type and should\nprobably be a \"map[string]any\" or \"map[any]any\".\nSee example below:\n\nGiven the input below, Other would be populated with the other\nvalues that weren't used (everything but \"name\"):\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to any other value, you may use the\n\",omitempty\" suffix on your tag to omit that value if it equates to\nthe zero value, or a zero-length element. The zero value of all types is\nspecified in the Go specification.\n\nFor example, the zero type of a numeric type is zero (\"0\"). If the struct\nfield value is zero and a numeric type, the field is empty, and it won't\nbe encoded into the destination type. And likewise for the URLs field, if the\nslice is nil or empty, it won't be encoded into the destination type.\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to any other value, you may use the\n\",omitzero\" suffix on your tag to omit that value if it equates to the zero\nvalue. The zero value of all types is specified in the Go specification.\n\nFor example, the zero type of a numeric type is zero (\"0\"). If the struct\nfield value is zero and a numeric type, the field is empty, and it won't\nbe encoded into the destination type. And likewise for the URLs field, if the\nslice is nil, it won't be encoded into the destination type.\n\nNote that if the field is a slice, and it is empty but not nil, it will\nstill be encoded into the destination type.\n\nSince unexported (private) struct fields cannot be set outside the package\nwhere they are defined, the decoder will simply skip them.\n\nFor this output type definition:\n\nUsing this map as input:\n\nThe following struct will be decoded:\n\nTypes can implement the Unmarshaler interface to control their own decoding. The interface\nbehaves similarly to how UnmarshalJSON does in the standard library. It can be used as an\nalternative or companion to a DecodeHook.\n\nSee the Unmarshaler interface documentation for more details.\n\nmapstructure is highly configurable.

supported.","licenses":[{"expression":"(MIT)"}],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/go-viper/mapstructure/v2@v2.4.0","externalReferences":[{"url":"https://github.com/go-viper/mapstructure","type":"website"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-viper/mapstructure/v2","type":"distribution"},{"url":"https://github.com/go-viper/mapstructure","type":"vcs"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-viper/mapstructure/v2#section-documentation","type":"documentation"}],"properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:be504ffc809244f987d79757ccfa917313bd387192992494527bc745e8c05819"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:d956c9c5fe9e14a48e6d73ac97cea3df120fffbdb1219c77991ec45d76a41ef5"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"github.com/go-viper/mapstructure/v2@v2.4.0"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"},{"name":"ecosystems:first_release_published_at","value":"2023-12-19T21:02:02Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:latest_release_published_at","value":"2025-07-15T08:59:08Z"}]},{"bom-ref":"1f111834-8fb6-4187-8030-16afa3b985b4","type":"library","supplier":{"name":"OpenAPI

implementing\nPOSIX/GNU-style --flags.\n\npflag is compatible with the GNU extensions to the POSIX recommendations\nfor command-line options. See\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argument-Syntax.html\n\nUsage:\n\npflag is a drop-in replacement of Go's native flag package. If you import\npflag under the name \"flag\" then all code should continue to function\nwith no changes.\n\nThere is one exception to this: if you directly instantiate the Flag struct\nthere is one more field \"Shorthand\" that you will need to set.\nMost code never instantiates this struct directly, and instead uses\nfunctions such as String(), BoolVar(), and Var(), and is therefore\nunaffected.\n\nDefine flags using flag.String(), Bool(), Int(), etc.\n\nThis declares an integer flag, -flagname, stored in the pointer ip, with type *int.\n\nIf you like, you can bind the flag to a variable using the Var() functions.\n\nOr you can create custom flags that satisfy the Value interface (with\npointer receivers) and couple them to flag parsing by\n\nFor such flags, the default value is just the initial value of the variable.\n\nAfter all flags are defined, call\n\nto parse the command line into the defined flags.\n\nFlags may then be used directly. If you're using the flags themselves,\nthey are all pointers; if you bind to variables, they're values.\n\nAfter parsing, the arguments after the flag are available as the\nslice flag.Args() or individually as flag.Arg(i).\nThe arguments are indexed from 0 through flag.NArg()-1.\n\nThe pflag package also defines some new functions that are not in flag,\nthat give one-letter shorthands for flags. You can use these by appending\n'P' to the name of any function that defines a flag.\n\nShorthand letters can be used with single dashes on the command line.\nBoolean shorthand flags can be combined with other shorthand flags.\n\nCommand line flag syntax:\n\nUnlike the flag package, a single dash before an option means something\ndifferent than a double dash. Single dashes signify a series of shorthand\nletters for flags. All but the last shorthand letter must be boolean flags.\n\nFlag parsing stops after the terminator \"--\". Unlike the flag package,\nflags can be interspersed with arguments anywhere on the command line\nbefore this terminator.\n\nInteger flags accept 1234, 0664, 0x1234 and may be negative.\nBoolean flags (in their long form) accept 1, 0, t, f, true, false,\nTRUE, FALSE, True, False.\nDuration flags accept any input valid for time.ParseDuration.\n\nThe default set of command-line flags is controlled by\ntop-level functions.  The FlagSet type allows one to define\nindependent sets of flags, such as to implement subcommands\nin a command-line interface. The methods of FlagSet are\nanalogous to the top-level functions for the command-line\nflag set.","licenses":[{"expression":"(BSD-3-Clause)"}],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/spf13/pflag@v1.0.6","externalReferences":[{"url":"https://github.com/spf13/pflag","type":"website"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/pflag","type":"distribution"},{"url":"https://github.com/spf13/pflag","type":"vcs"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/pflag#section-documentation","type":"documentation"}],"properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:6888b9d06e43a6f48204bacf65857d5f40325b0609ed22a5a2dcd8e849c74753"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:3dccafa3f67b159c6c51d6206d93d8ce98af27ac554918b926adc366bdaddf55"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"github.com/spf13/pflag@v1.0.6"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"},{"name":"ecosystems:first_release_published_at","value":"2017-05-08T18:44:08Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:latest_release_published_at","value":"2025-09-02T06:08:29Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:owner_location","value":"NYC"}]},{"bom-ref":"25fc4966-24a8-48c7-b5e1-a952fd071cf1","type":"library","supplier":{"name":"Amazon

The service also enables the client to fetch the user’s access token\nupon successful authentication and authorization with IAM Identity Center.\n\nIAM Identity Center uses the sso and identitystore API namespaces. IAM Identity\nCenter OpenID Connect uses the sso-oauth namespace.\n\nBefore you begin using this guide, we recommend that you first review the\nfollowing important information about how the IAM Identity Center OIDC service\nworks.\n\nThe IAM Identity Center OIDC service currently implements only the portions\nof the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant standard (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628 ) that are necessary to\nenable single sign-on authentication with the CLI.\n\nWith older versions of the CLI, the service only emits OIDC access tokens,\nso to obtain a new token, users must explicitly re-authenticate.

provides a generalized type to opaquely represent message\ndigests and their operations within the registry. The Digest type is\ndesigned to serve as a flexible identifier in a content-addressable system.\nMore importantly, it provides tools and wrappers to work with\nhash.Hash-based digests with little effort.\n\nThe format of a digest is simply a string with two parts, dubbed the\n\"algorithm\" and the \"digest\", separated by a colon:\n\nAn example of a sha256 digest representation follows:\n\nThe \"algorithm\" portion defines both the hashing algorithm used to calculate\nthe digest and the encoding of the resulting digest, which defaults to \"hex\"\nif not otherwise specified. Currently, all supported algorithms have their\ndigests encoded in hex strings.\n\nIn the example above, the string \"sha256\" is the algorithm and the hex bytes\nare the \"digest\".\n\nBecause the Digest type is simply a string, once a valid Digest is\nobtained, comparisons are cheap, quick and simple to express with the\nstandard equality operator.\n\nThe main benefit of using the Digest type is simple verification against a\ngiven digest. The Verifier interface, modeled after the stdlib hash.Hash\ninterface, provides a common write sink for digest verification. After\nwriting is complete, calling the Verifier.Verified method will indicate\nwhether or not the stream of bytes matches the target digest.\n\nIn addition to the above, we intend to add the following features to this\npackage:\n\n1. A Digester type that supports write sink digest calculation.\n\n2.

See go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric for the official\nOpenTelemetry implementation of this API.\n\nAll measurements made with this package are made via instruments. These\ninstruments are created by a Meter which itself is created by a\nMeterProvider. Applications need to accept a MeterProvider implementation\nas a starting point when instrumenting. This can be done directly, or by using\nthe OpenTelemetry global MeterProvider via GetMeterProvider. Using an\nappropriately named Meter from the accepted MeterProvider, instrumentation\ncan then be built from the Meter's instruments.\n\nEach instrument is designed to make measurements of a particular type. Broadly,\nall instruments fall into two overlapping logical categories: asynchronous or\nsynchronous, and int64 or float64.\n\nAll synchronous instruments (Int64Counter, Int64UpDownCounter,\nInt64Histogram, Float64Counter, Float64UpDownCounter, and\nFloat64Histogram) are used to measure the operation and performance of source\ncode during the source code execution. These instruments only make measurements\nwhen the source code they instrument is run.\n\nAll asynchronous instruments (Int64ObservableCounter,\nInt64ObservableUpDownCounter, Int64ObservableGauge,\nFloat64ObservableCounter, Float64ObservableUpDownCounter, and\nFloat64ObservableGauge) are used to measure metrics outside of the execution\nof source code. They are said to make \"observations\" via a callback function\ncalled once every measurement collection cycle.\n\nEach instrument is also grouped by the value type it measures. Either int64 or\nfloat64. The value being measured will dictate which instrument in these\ncategories to use.\n\nOutside of these two broad categories, instruments are described by the\nfunction they are designed to serve. All Counters (Int64Counter,\nFloat64Counter, Int64ObservableCounter, and Float64ObservableCounter) are\ndesigned to measure values that never decrease in value, but instead only\nincrementally increase in value. UpDownCounters (Int64UpDownCounter,\nFloat64UpDownCounter, Int64ObservableUpDownCounter, and\nFloat64ObservableUpDownCounter) on the other hand, are designed to measure\nvalues that can increase and decrease. When more information needs to be\nconveyed about all the synchronous measurements made during a collection cycle,\na Histogram (Int64Histogram and Float64Histogram) should be used. Finally,\nwhen just the most recent measurement needs to be conveyed about an\nasynchronous measurement, a Gauge (Int64ObservableGauge and\nFloat64ObservableGauge) should be used.\n\nSee the OpenTelemetry documentation for more information about instruments\nand their intended use.\n\nOpenTelemetry defines an instrument name syntax that restricts what\ninstrument names are allowed.\n\nInstrument names should ...\n\nTo ensure compatibility with observability platforms, all instruments created\nneed to conform to this syntax. Not all implementations of the API will validate\nthese names, it is the callers responsibility to ensure compliance.\n\nMeasurements are made by recording values and information about the values with\nan instrument. How these measurements are recorded depends on the instrument.\n\nMeasurements for synchronous instruments (Int64Counter, Int64UpDownCounter,\nInt64Histogram, Float64Counter, Float64UpDownCounter, and\nFloat64Histogram) are recorded using the instrument methods directly. All\ncounter instruments have an Add method that is used to measure an increment\nvalue, and all histogram instruments have a Record method to measure a data\npoint.\n\nAsynchronous instruments (Int64ObservableCounter,\nInt64ObservableUpDownCounter, Int64ObservableGauge,\nFloat64ObservableCounter, Float64ObservableUpDownCounter, and\nFloat64ObservableGauge) record measurements within a callback function. The\ncallback is registered with the Meter which ensures the callback is called once\nper collection cycle. A callback can be registered two ways: during the\ninstrument's creation using an option, or later using the RegisterCallback\nmethod of the Meter that created the instrument.\n\nIf the following criteria are met, an option (WithInt64Callback or\nWithFloat64Callback) can be used during the asynchronous instrument's\ncreation to register a callback (Int64Callback or Float64Callback,\nrespectively):\n\nIf the criteria are not met, use the RegisterCallback method of the Meter that\ncreated the instrument to register a Callback.\n\nThis package does not conform to the standard Go versioning policy, all of its\ninterfaces may have methods added to them without a package major version bump.\nThis non-standard API evolution could surprise an uninformed implementation\nauthor. They could unknowingly build their implementation in a way that would\nresult in a runtime panic for their users that update to the new API.\n\nThe API is designed to help inform an instrumentation author about this\nnon-standard API evolution. It requires them to choose a default behavior for\nunimplemented interface methods. There are three behavior choices they can\nmake:\n\nAll interfaces in this API embed a corresponding interface from\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/embedded. If an author wants the default\nbehavior of their implementations to be a compilation failure, signaling to\ntheir users they need to update to the latest version of that implementation,\nthey need to embed the corresponding interface from\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/embedded in their implementation. For\nexample,\n\nIf an author wants the default behavior of their implementations to a panic,\nthey need to embed the API interface directly.\n\nThis is not a recommended behavior as it could lead to publishing packages that\ncontain runtime panics when users update other package that use newer versions\nof go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric.\n\nFinally, an author can embed another implementation in theirs. The embedded\nimplementation will be used for methods not defined by the author. For example,\nan author who wants to default to silently dropping the call can use\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/noop:\n\nIt is strongly recommended that authors only embed\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/noop if they choose this default behavior.\nThat implementation is the only one OpenTelemetry authors can guarantee will\nfully implement all the API interfaces when a user updates their API.","purl":"pkg:golang/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric@v1.39.0","externalReferences":[{"url":"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go","type":"website"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric","type":"distribution"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric#section-documentation","type":"documentation"}],"properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:be504ffc809244f987d79757ccfa917313bd387192992494527bc745e8c05819"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:d956c9c5fe9e14a48e6d73ac97cea3df120fffbdb1219c77991ec45d76a41ef5"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric@v1.39.0"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"},{"name":"ecosystems:first_release_published_at","value":"2021-02-15T18:48:14Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:latest_release_published_at","value":"2026-02-02T17:46:33Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"logging"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"metrics"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"opentelemetry"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"tracing"}]},{"bom-ref":"3329756d-71f8-4ade-80c5-ad3c4db6041f","type":"library","supplier":{"name":"Amazon Web Services","url":["https://amazon.com/aws"]},"author":"Amazon Web Services","name":"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config","version":"v1.32.6","description":"Package config provides utilities for loading configuration from multiple\nsources that can be used to configure the SDK's API clients, and utilities.\n\nThe config package will load configuration from environment variables, AWS\nshared configuration file (~/.aws/config), and AWS shared credentials file\n(~/.aws/credentials).\n\nUse the LoadDefaultConfig to load configuration from all the SDK's supported\nsources, and resolve credentials using the SDK's default credential chain.\n\nLoadDefaultConfig allows for a variadic list of additional Config sources that can\nprovide one or more configuration values which can be used to programmatically control the resolution\nof a specific value, or allow for broader range of additional configuration sources not supported by the SDK.\nA Config source implements one or more provider interfaces defined in this package.

convert one arbitrary\nGo type into another, typically to convert a map[string]interface{}\ninto a native Go structure.\n\nThe Go structure can be arbitrarily complex, containing slices,\nother structs, etc. and the decoder will properly decode nested\nmaps and so on into the proper structures in the native Go struct.\nSee the examples to see what the decoder is capable of.\n\nThe simplest function to start with is Decode.\n\nWhen decoding to a struct, mapstructure will use the field name by\ndefault to perform the mapping. For example, if a struct has a field\n\"Username\" then mapstructure will look for a key in the source value\nof \"username\" (case insensitive).\n\nYou can change the behavior of mapstructure by using struct tags.\nThe default struct tag that mapstructure looks for is \"mapstructure\"\nbut you can customize it using DecoderConfig.\n\nTo rename the key that mapstructure looks for, use the \"mapstructure\"\ntag and set a value directly. For example, to change the \"username\" example\nabove to \"user\":\n\nEmbedded structs are treated as if they're another field with that name.\nBy default, the two structs below are equivalent when decoding with\nmapstructure:\n\nThis would require an input that looks like below:\n\nIf your \"person\" value is NOT nested, then you can append \",squash\" to\nyour tag value and mapstructure will treat it as if the embedded struct\nwere part of the struct directly. Example:\n\nNow the following input would be accepted:\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to a map, the squash tag squashes the struct\nfields into a single map. Using the example structs from above:\n\nWill be decoded into a map:\n\nDecoderConfig has a field that changes the behavior of mapstructure\nto always squash embedded structs.\n\nIf there are any unmapped keys in the source value, mapstructure by\ndefault will silently ignore them. You can error by setting ErrorUnused\nin DecoderConfig. If you're using Metadata you can also maintain a slice\nof the unused keys.\n\nYou can also use the \",remain\" suffix on your tag to collect all unused\nvalues in a map. The field with this tag MUST be a map type and should\nprobably be a \"map[string]interface{}\" or \"map[interface{}]interface{}\".\nSee example below:\n\nGiven the input below, Other would be populated with the other\nvalues that weren't used (everything but \"name\"):\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to any other value, you may use the\n\",omitempty\" suffix on your tag to omit that value if it equates to\nthe zero value. The zero value of all types is specified in the Go\nspecification.\n\nFor example, the zero type of a numeric type is zero (\"0\"). If the struct\nfield value is zero and a numeric type, the field is empty, and it won't\nbe encoded into the destination type.\n\nSince unexported (private) struct fields cannot be set outside the package\nwhere they are defined, the decoder will simply skip them.\n\nFor this output type definition:\n\nUsing this map as input:\n\nThe following struct will be decoded:\n\nmapstructure is highly configurable.

For example\n\nIf additional control is required, the errors.WithStack and\nerrors.WithMessage functions destructure errors.Wrap into its component\noperations: annotating an error with a stack trace and with a message,\nrespectively.\n\nUsing errors.Wrap constructs a stack of errors, adding context to the\npreceding error. Depending on the nature of the error it may be necessary\nto reverse the operation of errors.Wrap to retrieve the original error\nfor inspection. Any error value which implements this interface\n\ncan be inspected by errors.Cause. errors.Cause will recursively retrieve\nthe topmost error that does not implement causer, which is assumed to be\nthe original cause. For example:\n\nAlthough the causer interface is not exported by this package, it is\nconsidered a part of its stable public interface.\n\nAll error values returned from this package implement fmt.Formatter and can\nbe formatted by the fmt package. The following verbs are supported:\n\nNew, Errorf, Wrap, and Wrapf record a stack trace at the point they are\ninvoked. This information can be retrieved with the following interface:\n\nThe returned errors.StackTrace type is defined as\n\nThe Frame type represents a call site in the stack trace. Frame supports\nthe fmt.Formatter interface that can be used for printing information about\nthe stack trace of this error.

implementing\nPOSIX/GNU-style --flags.\n\npflag is compatible with the GNU extensions to the POSIX recommendations\nfor command-line options. See\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argument-Syntax.html\n\nUsage:\n\npflag is a drop-in replacement of Go's native flag package. If you import\npflag under the name \"flag\" then all code should continue to function\nwith no changes.\n\nThere is one exception to this: if you directly instantiate the Flag struct\nthere is one more field \"Shorthand\" that you will need to set.\nMost code never instantiates this struct directly, and instead uses\nfunctions such as String(), BoolVar(), and Var(), and is therefore\nunaffected.\n\nDefine flags using flag.String(), Bool(), Int(), etc.\n\nThis declares an integer flag, -flagname, stored in the pointer ip, with type *int.\n\nIf you like, you can bind the flag to a variable using the Var() functions.\n\nOr you can create custom flags that satisfy the Value interface (with\npointer receivers) and couple them to flag parsing by\n\nFor such flags, the default value is just the initial value of the variable.\n\nAfter all flags are defined, call\n\nto parse the command line into the defined flags.\n\nFlags may then be used directly. If you're using the flags themselves,\nthey are all pointers; if you bind to variables, they're values.\n\nAfter parsing, the arguments after the flag are available as the\nslice flag.Args() or individually as flag.Arg(i).\nThe arguments are indexed from 0 through flag.NArg()-1.\n\nThe pflag package also defines some new functions that are not in flag,\nthat give one-letter shorthands for flags. You can use these by appending\n'P' to the name of any function that defines a flag.\n\nShorthand letters can be used with single dashes on the command line.\nBoolean shorthand flags can be combined with other shorthand flags.\n\nCommand line flag syntax:\n\nUnlike the flag package, a single dash before an option means something\ndifferent than a double dash. Single dashes signify a series of shorthand\nletters for flags. All but the last shorthand letter must be boolean flags.\n\nFlag parsing stops after the terminator \"--\". Unlike the flag package,\nflags can be interspersed with arguments anywhere on the command line\nbefore this terminator.\n\nInteger flags accept 1234, 0664, 0x1234 and may be negative.\nBoolean flags (in their long form) accept 1, 0, t, f, true, false,\nTRUE, FALSE, True, False.\nDuration flags accept any input valid for time.ParseDuration.\n\nThe default set of command-line flags is controlled by\ntop-level functions.  The FlagSet type allows one to define\nindependent sets of flags, such as to implement subcommands\nin a command-line interface. The methods of FlagSet are\nanalogous to the top-level functions for the command-line\nflag set.","licenses":[{"expression":"(BSD-3-Clause)"}],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/spf13/pflag@v1.0.6","externalReferences":[{"url":"https://github.com/spf13/pflag","type":"website"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/pflag","type":"distribution"},{"url":"https://github.com/spf13/pflag","type":"vcs"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/pflag#section-documentation","type":"documentation"}],"properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:be504ffc809244f987d79757ccfa917313bd387192992494527bc745e8c05819"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:d956c9c5fe9e14a48e6d73ac97cea3df120fffbdb1219c77991ec45d76a41ef5"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"github.com/spf13/pflag@v1.0.6"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"},{"name":"ecosystems:first_release_published_at","value":"2017-05-08T18:44:08Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:latest_release_published_at","value":"2025-09-02T06:08:29Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:owner_location","value":"NYC"}]},{"bom-ref":"4cf849d1-3276-42e8-b4dd-84e8c4c71587","type":"library","supplier":{"name":"Stretchr, Inc.","url":["http://www.stretchr.com/"]},"author":"Stretchr, Inc.","name":"github.com/stretchr/testify","version":"v1.11.1","description":"Module testify is a set of packages that provide many tools for testifying that your code will behave as you intend.\n\nTestify contains the following packages:\n\nThe github.com/stretchr/testify/assert package provides a comprehensive set of assertion functions that tie in to the Go testing system.\nThe github.com/stretchr/testify/require package provides the same assertions but as fatal checks.\n\nThe github.com/stretchr/testify/mock package provides a system by which it is possible to mock your objects and verify calls are happening as expected.\n\nThe github.com/stretchr/testify/suite package provides a basic structure for using structs as testing suites, and methods on those structs as tests.

Hashimoto","name":"github.com/mitchellh/mapstructure","version":"v1.5.0","description":"Package mapstructure exposes functionality to convert one arbitrary\nGo type into another, typically to convert a map[string]interface{}\ninto a native Go structure.\n\nThe Go structure can be arbitrarily complex, containing slices,\nother structs, etc. and the decoder will properly decode nested\nmaps and so on into the proper structures in the native Go struct.\nSee the examples to see what the decoder is capable of.\n\nThe simplest function to start with is Decode.\n\nWhen decoding to a struct, mapstructure will use the field name by\ndefault to perform the mapping. For example, if a struct has a field\n\"Username\" then mapstructure will look for a key in the source value\nof \"username\" (case insensitive).\n\nYou can change the behavior of mapstructure by using struct tags.\nThe default struct tag that mapstructure looks for is \"mapstructure\"\nbut you can customize it using DecoderConfig.\n\nTo rename the key that mapstructure looks for, use the \"mapstructure\"\ntag and set a value directly. For example, to change the \"username\" example\nabove to \"user\":\n\nEmbedded structs are treated as if they're another field with that name.\nBy default, the two structs below are equivalent when decoding with\nmapstructure:\n\nThis would require an input that looks like below:\n\nIf your \"person\" value is NOT nested, then you can append \",squash\" to\nyour tag value and mapstructure will treat it as if the embedded struct\nwere part of the struct directly. Example:\n\nNow the following input would be accepted:\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to a map, the squash tag squashes the struct\nfields into a single map. Using the example structs from above:\n\nWill be decoded into a map:\n\nDecoderConfig has a field that changes the behavior of mapstructure\nto always squash embedded structs.\n\nIf there are any unmapped keys in the source value, mapstructure by\ndefault will silently ignore them. You can error by setting ErrorUnused\nin DecoderConfig. If you're using Metadata you can also maintain a slice\nof the unused keys.\n\nYou can also use the \",remain\" suffix on your tag to collect all unused\nvalues in a map. The field with this tag MUST be a map type and should\nprobably be a \"map[string]interface{}\" or \"map[interface{}]interface{}\".\nSee example below:\n\nGiven the input below, Other would be populated with the other\nvalues that weren't used (everything but \"name\"):\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to any other value, you may use the\n\",omitempty\" suffix on your tag to omit that value if it equates to\nthe zero value. The zero value of all types is specified in the Go\nspecification.\n\nFor example, the zero type of a numeric type is zero (\"0\"). If the struct\nfield value is zero and a numeric type, the field is empty, and it won't\nbe encoded into the destination type.\n\nSince unexported (private) struct fields cannot be set outside the package\nwhere they are defined, the decoder will simply skip them.\n\nFor this output type definition:\n\nUsing this map as input:\n\nThe following struct will be decoded:\n\nmapstructure is highly configurable.

Cloud\nServices. See https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/api for a full list of\nsub-packages.\n\nWithin api there exist numerous clients which connect to Google APIs,\nand various utility packages.\n\nAll clients in sub-packages are configurable via client options. These\noptions are described here: https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/api/option.\n\nAll the clients in sub-packages support authentication via Google\nApplication Default Credentials (see\nhttps://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production), or by providing a\nJSON key file for a Service Account. See the authentication examples in\nhttps://godoc.org/google.golang.org/api/transport for more details.\n\nDue to the auto-generated nature of this collection of libraries, complete\nAPIs or specific versions can appear or go away without notice. As a result,\nyou should always locally vendor any API(s) that your code relies upon.\n\nGoogle APIs follow semver as specified by\nhttps://cloud.google.com/apis/design/versioning. The code generator and\nthe code it produces - the libraries in the google.golang.org/api/...\nsubpackages - are beta.\n\nNote that versioning and stability is strictly not communicated through Go\nmodules. Go modules are used only for dependency management.\n\nMany parameters are specified using ints. However, underlying APIs might\noperate on a finer granularity, expecting int64, int32, uint64, or uint32,\nall of whom have different maximum values. Subsequently, specifying an int\nparameter in one of these clients may result in an error from the API\nbecause the value is too large.\n\nTo see the exact type of int that the API expects, you can inspect the API's\ndiscovery doc. A global catalogue pointing to the discovery doc of APIs can\nbe found at https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis.\n\nThis field can be found on all Request/Response structs in the generated\nclients. All of these types have the JSON `omitempty` field tag present on\ntheir fields. This means if a type is set to its default value it will not be\nmarshalled. Sometimes you may actually want to send a default value, for\ninstance sending an int of `0`. In this case you can override the `omitempty`\nfeature by adding the field name to the `ForceSendFields` slice. See docs on\nany struct for more details. This may be used to include empty fields in\nPatch requests.\n\nThis field can be found on all Request/Response structs in the generated\nclients. It can be be used to send JSON null values for the listed fields.\nBy default, fields with empty values are omitted from API requests because of\nthe presence of the `omitempty` field tag on all fields. However, any field\nwith an empty value appearing in NullFields will be sent to the server as\nnull. It is an error if a field in this list has a non-empty value. This may\nbe used to include null fields in Patch requests.\n\nAn error returned by a client's Do method may be cast to a *googleapi.Error\nor unwrapped to an *apierror.APIError.\n\nThe https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/googleapi#Error type is useful\nfor getting the HTTP status code:\n\nThe https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/googleapis/gax-go/v2/apierror#APIError type\nis useful for inspecting structured details of the underlying API response,\nsuch as the reason for the error and the error domain, which is typically the\nregistered service name of the tool or product that generated the error:\n\nIf an API call returns an Operation, that means it could take some time to\ncomplete the work initiated by the API call. Applications that are interested\nin the end result of the operation they initiated should wait until the\nOperation.Done field indicates it is finished. To do this, use the service's\nOperation client, and a loop, like

An implementation of the OpenTelemetry SDK, like the\ndefault SDK implementation (go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk), and associated\nexporters are used to process and transport this data.\n\nTo read the getting started guide, see https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/go/getting-started/.\n\nTo read more about tracing, see go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace.\n\nTo read more about metrics, see go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric.\n\nTo read more about logs, see go.opentelemetry.io/otel/log.\n\nTo read more about propagation, see go.opentelemetry.io/otel/propagation and\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/baggage.","purl":"pkg:golang/go.opentelemetry.io/otel@v1.39.0","externalReferences":[{"url":"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go","type":"website"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel","type":"distribution"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel#section-documentation","type":"documentation"}],"properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:be504ffc809244f987d79757ccfa917313bd387192992494527bc745e8c05819"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:d956c9c5fe9e14a48e6d73ac97cea3df120fffbdb1219c77991ec45d76a41ef5"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"go.opentelemetry.io/otel@v1.39.0"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"},{"name":"ecosystems:first_release_published_at","value":"2019-11-04T19:45:51Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:latest_release_published_at","value":"2026-02-02T17:46:33Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"logging"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"metrics"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"opentelemetry"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"tracing"}]},{"bom-ref":"5e7b2305-adf2-424d-b9ef-6fc2f412f4f8","type":"library","name":"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/lightsail","version":"v1.50.10","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/lightsail@v1.50.10","properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:be504ffc809244f987d79757ccfa917313bd387192992494527bc745e8c05819"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:d956c9c5fe9e14a48e6d73ac97cea3df120fffbdb1219c77991ec45d76a41ef5"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/lightsail@v1.50.10"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"}]},{"bom-ref":"5f039144-0b80-4944-a049-095d5e495d45","type":"library","name":"github.com/linode/linodego","version":"v1.63.0","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/linode/linodego@v1.63.0","properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:be504ffc809244f987d79757ccfa917313bd387192992494527bc745e8c05819"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:d956c9c5fe9e14a48e6d73ac97cea3df120fffbdb1219c77991ec45d76a41ef5"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"github.com/linode/linodego@v1.63.0"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"}]},{"bom-ref":"5f4b9f86-dbeb-4c65-916c-01e8431f784c","type":"library","supplier":{"name":"Amazon Web Services","url":["https://amazon.com/aws"]},"author":"Amazon Web Services","name":"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/feature/ec2/imds","version":"v1.18.16","description":"Package imds provides the API client for interacting with the Amazon EC2\nInstance Metadata Service.\n\nAll Client operation calls have a default timeout.

clientgo is the official Go client for the Kubernetes API. It provides\na standard set of clients and tools for building applications, controllers,\nand operators that communicate with a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nkubernetes: Contains the typed Clientset for interacting with built-in,\nversioned API objects (e.g., Pods, Deployments). This is the most common\nstarting point.\n\ndynamic: Provides a dynamic client that can perform operations on any\nKubernetes object, including Custom Resources (CRs). It is essential for\nbuilding controllers that work with CRDs.\n\ndiscovery: Used to discover the API groups, versions, and resources\nsupported by a Kubernetes cluster.\n\ntools/cache: The foundation of the controller pattern. This package provides\nefficient caching and synchronization mechanisms (Informers and Listers)\nfor building controllers.\n\ntools/clientcmd: Provides methods for loading client configuration from\nkubeconfig files. This is essential for out-of-cluster applications and CLI tools.\n\nrest: Provides a lower-level RESTClient that manages the details of\ncommunicating with the Kubernetes API server. It is useful for advanced\nuse cases that require fine-grained control over requests, such as working\nwith non-standard REST verbs.\n\nThere are two primary ways to configure a client to connect to the API server:\n\nIn-Cluster Configuration: For applications running inside a Kubernetes pod,\nthe `rest.InClusterConfig()` function provides a straightforward way to\nconfigure the client. It automatically uses the pod's service account for\nauthentication and is the recommended approach for controllers and operators.\n\nOut-of-Cluster Configuration: For local development or command-line tools,\nthe `clientcmd` package is used to load configuration from a\nkubeconfig file.\n\nThe `rest.Config` object allows for fine-grained control over client-side\nperformance and reliability. Key settings include:\n\nOnce configured, a client can be used to interact with objects in the cluster.\n\nThe Typed Clientset (`kubernetes` package) provides a strongly typed\ninterface for working with built-in Kubernetes objects.\n\nThe Dynamic Client (`dynamic` package) can work with any object, including\nCustom Resources, using `unstructured.Unstructured` types.\n\nFor Custom Resources (CRDs), the `k8s.io/code-generator` repository\ncontains the tools to generate typed clients, informers, and listers. The\n`sample-controller` is the canonical example of this pattern.\n\nServer-Side Apply is a patching strategy that allows multiple actors to\nshare management of an object by tracking field ownership. This prevents\nactors from inadvertently overwriting each other's changes and provides\na mechanism for resolving conflicts. The `applyconfigurations` package\nprovides the necessary tools for this declarative approach.\n\nRobust error handling is essential when interacting with the API. The\n`k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/api/errors` package provides functions to inspect\nerrors and check for common conditions, such as whether a resource was not\nfound or already exists. This allows controllers to implement robust,\nidempotent reconciliation logic.\n\nThe controller pattern is central to Kubernetes. A controller observes the\nstate of the cluster and works to bring it to the desired state.\n\nThe `tools/cache` package provides the building blocks for this pattern.\nInformers watch the API server and maintain a local cache, Listers provide\nread-only access to the cache, and Workqueues decouple event detection\nfrom processing.\n\nIn a high-availability deployment where multiple instances of a controller\nare running, leader election (`tools/leaderelection`) is used to ensure\nthat only one instance is active at a time.\n\nClient-side feature gates allow for enabling or disabling experimental\nfeatures in `client-go`.

tracing part of the\nOpenTelemetry API.\n\nTo participate in distributed traces a Span needs to be created for the\noperation being performed as part of a traced workflow. In its simplest form:\n\nA Tracer is unique to the instrumentation and is used to create Spans.\nInstrumentation should be designed to accept a TracerProvider from which it\ncan create its own unique Tracer. Alternatively, the registered global\nTracerProvider from the go.opentelemetry.io/otel package can be used as\na default.\n\nThis package does not conform to the standard Go versioning policy; all of its\ninterfaces may have methods added to them without a package major version bump.\nThis non-standard API evolution could surprise an uninformed implementation\nauthor. They could unknowingly build their implementation in a way that would\nresult in a runtime panic for their users that update to the new API.\n\nThe API is designed to help inform an instrumentation author about this\nnon-standard API evolution. It requires them to choose a default behavior for\nunimplemented interface methods. There are three behavior choices they can\nmake:\n\nAll interfaces in this API embed a corresponding interface from\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace/embedded. If an author wants the default\nbehavior of their implementations to be a compilation failure, signaling to\ntheir users they need to update to the latest version of that implementation,\nthey need to embed the corresponding interface from\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace/embedded in their implementation. For\nexample,\n\nIf an author wants the default behavior of their implementations to panic, they\ncan embed the API interface directly.\n\nThis option is not recommended. It will lead to publishing packages that\ncontain runtime panics when users update to newer versions of\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace, which may be done with a transitive\ndependency.\n\nFinally, an author can embed another implementation in theirs. The embedded\nimplementation will be used for methods not defined by the author. For example,\nan author who wants to default to silently dropping the call can use\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace/noop:\n\nIt is strongly recommended that authors only embed\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace/noop if they choose this default behavior.\nThat implementation is the only one OpenTelemetry authors can guarantee will\nfully implement all the API interfaces when a user updates their API.","purl":"pkg:golang/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace@v1.39.0","externalReferences":[{"url":"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go","type":"website"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace","type":"distribution"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace#section-documentation","type":"documentation"}],"properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:be504ffc809244f987d79757ccfa917313bd387192992494527bc745e8c05819"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:d956c9c5fe9e14a48e6d73ac97cea3df120fffbdb1219c77991ec45d76a41ef5"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace@v1.39.0"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"},{"name":"ecosystems:first_release_published_at","value":"2021-02-15T18:48:14Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:latest_release_published_at","value":"2025-08-29T19:42:52Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"metrics"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"opentelemetry"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"tracing"}]},{"bom-ref":"72f13be1-f802-46ad-800b-f3a880738a66","type":"library","name":"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/signin","version":"v1.0.4","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/signin@v1.0.4","externalReferences":[{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/signin","type":"distribution"},{"url":"https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2","type":"vcs"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/signin#section-documentation","type":"documentation"}],"properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:be504ffc809244f987d79757ccfa917313bd387192992494527bc745e8c05819"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:d956c9c5fe9e14a48e6d73ac97cea3df120fffbdb1219c77991ec45d76a41ef5"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/signin@v1.0.4"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"},{"name":"ecosystems:first_release_published_at","value":"2025-11-19T19:15:04Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:latest_release_published_at","value":"2026-01-09T19:14:10Z"}]},{"bom-ref":"7371eebc-8ae5-4caa-8e09-570db2fc4394","type":"library","supplier":{"name":"OpenTelemetry

The package allows\ncomplete control over what is sent out to the DNS. The API follows the\nless-is-more principle, by presenting a small, clean interface.\n\nIt supports (asynchronous) querying/replying, incoming/outgoing zone transfers,\nTSIG, EDNS0, dynamic updates, notifies and DNSSEC validation/signing.\n\nNote that domain names MUST be fully qualified before sending them, unqualified\nnames in a message will result in a packing failure.\n\nResource records are native types. They are not stored in wire format. Basic\nusage pattern for creating a new resource record:\n\nOr directly from a string:\n\nOr when the default origin (.) and TTL (3600) and class (IN) suit you:\n\nOr even:\n\nIn the DNS messages are exchanged, these messages contain resource records\n(sets). Use pattern for creating a message:\n\nOr when not certain if the domain name is fully qualified:\n\nThe message m is now a message with the question section set to ask the MX\nrecords for the miek.nl. zone.\n\nThe following is slightly more verbose, but more flexible:\n\nAfter creating a message it can be sent. Basic use pattern for synchronous\nquerying the DNS at a server configured on 127.0.0.1 and port 53:\n\nSuppressing multiple outstanding queries (with the same question, type and\nclass) is as easy as setting:\n\nMore advanced options are available using a net.Dialer and the corresponding API.\nFor example it is possible to set a timeout, or to specify a source IP address\nand port to use for the connection:\n\nIf these \"advanced\" features are not needed, a simple UDP query can be sent,\nwith:\n\nWhen this functions returns you will get DNS message. A DNS message consists\nout of four sections.\nThe question section: in.Question, the answer section: in.Answer,\nthe authority section: in.Ns and the additional section: in.Extra.\n\nEach of these sections (except the Question section) contain a []RR. Basic\nuse pattern for accessing the rdata of a TXT RR as the first RR in\nthe Answer section:\n\nBoth domain names and TXT character strings are converted to presentation form\nboth when unpacked and when converted to strings.\n\nFor TXT character strings, tabs, carriage returns and line feeds will be\nconverted to \\t, \\r and \\n respectively. Back slashes and quotations marks will\nbe escaped. Bytes below 32 and above 127 will be converted to \\DDD form.\n\nFor domain names, in addition to the above rules brackets, periods, spaces,\nsemicolons and the at symbol are escaped.\n\nDNSSEC (DNS Security Extension) adds a layer of security to the DNS. It uses\npublic key cryptography to sign resource records. The public keys are stored in\nDNSKEY records and the signatures in RRSIG records.\n\nRequesting DNSSEC information for a zone is done by adding the DO (DNSSEC OK)\nbit to a request.\n\nSignature generation, signature verification and key generation are all supported.\n\nDynamic updates reuses the DNS message format, but renames three of the\nsections. Question is Zone, Answer is Prerequisite, Authority is Update, only\nthe Additional is not renamed. See RFC 2136 for the gory details.\n\nYou can set a rather complex set of rules for the existence of absence of\ncertain resource records or names in a zone to specify if resource records\nshould be added or removed. The table from RFC 2136 supplemented with the Go\nDNS function shows which functions exist to specify the prerequisites.\n\nThe prerequisite section can also be left empty. If you have decided on the\nprerequisites you can tell what RRs should be added or deleted. The next table\nshows the options you have and what functions to call.\n\nAn TSIG or transaction signature adds a HMAC TSIG record to each message sent.\nThe supported algorithms include: HmacSHA1, HmacSHA256 and HmacSHA512.\n\nBasic use pattern when querying with a TSIG name \"axfr.\" (note that these key names\nmust be fully qualified - as they are domain names) and the base64 secret\n\"so6ZGir4GPAqINNh9U5c3A==\":\n\nIf an incoming message contains a TSIG record it MUST be the last record in\nthe additional section (RFC2845 3.2).  This means that you should make the\ncall to SetTsig last, right before executing the query.  If you make any\nchanges to the RRset after calling SetTsig() the signature will be incorrect.\n\nWhen requesting an zone transfer (almost all TSIG usage is when requesting zone\ntransfers), with TSIG, this is the basic use pattern. In this example we\nrequest an AXFR for miek.nl. with TSIG key named \"axfr.\" and secret\n\"so6ZGir4GPAqINNh9U5c3A==\" and using the server 176.58.119.54:\n\nYou can now read the records from the transfer as they come in. Each envelope\nis checked with TSIG. If something is not correct an error is returned.\n\nA custom TSIG implementation can be used. This requires additional code to\nperform any session establishment and signature generation/verification. The\nclient must be configured with an implementation of the TsigProvider interface:\n\nBasic use pattern validating and replying to a message that has TSIG set.\n\nRFC 6895 sets aside a range of type codes for private use. This range is 65,280\n- 65,534 (0xFF00 - 0xFFFE). When experimenting with new Resource Records these\ncan be used, before requesting an official type code from IANA.\n\nSee https://miek.nl/2014/september/21/idn-and-private-rr-in-go-dns/ for more\ninformation.\n\nEDNS0 is an extension mechanism for the DNS defined in RFC 2671 and updated by\nRFC 6891. It defines a new RR type, the OPT RR, which is then completely\nabused.\n\nBasic use pattern for creating an (empty) OPT RR:\n\nThe rdata of an OPT RR consists out of a slice of EDNS0 (RFC 6891) interfaces.\nCurrently only a few have been standardized: EDNS0_NSID (RFC 5001) and\nEDNS0_SUBNET (RFC 7871). Note that these options may be combined in an OPT RR.\nBasic use pattern for a server to check if (and which) options are set:\n\nSIG(0)\n\nFrom RFC 2931:\n\nIt works like TSIG, except that SIG(0) uses public key cryptography, instead of\nthe shared secret approach in TSIG. Supported algorithms: ECDSAP256SHA256,\nECDSAP384SHA384, RSASHA1, RSASHA256 and RSASHA512.\n\nSigning subsequent messages in multi-message sessions is not implemented.","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/miekg/dns@v1.1.69","externalReferences":[{"url":"https://github.com/miekg/dns","type":"website"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/miekg/dns","type":"distribution"},{"url":"https://github.com/miekg/dns","type":"vcs"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/miekg/dns#section-documentation","type":"documentation"}],"properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:6888b9d06e43a6f48204bacf65857d5f40325b0609ed22a5a2dcd8e849c74753"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:3dccafa3f67b159c6c51d6206d93d8ce98af27ac554918b926adc366bdaddf55"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"github.com/miekg/dns@v1.1.69"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"},{"name":"ecosystems:first_release_published_at","value":"2017-12-06T09:46:54Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:latest_release_published_at","value":"2026-01-22T08:23:52Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"dns"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"dns-library"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"dnssec"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"go"}]},{"bom-ref":"79710431-35c1-407c-b855-0c3644ae263a","type":"library","supplier":{"name":"pkg"},"author":"pkg","name":"github.com/pkg/errors","version":"v0.9.1","description":"Package errors provides simple error handling primitives.\n\nThe traditional error handling idiom in Go is roughly akin to\n\nwhich when applied recursively up the call stack results in error reports\nwithout context or debugging information.

- CNCF","url":["https://opentelemetry.io"]},"author":"OpenTelemetry - CNCF","name":"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric","version":"v1.39.0","description":"Package metric provides the OpenTelemetry API used to measure metrics about\nsource code operation.\n\nThis API is separate from its implementation so the instrumentation built from\nit is reusable. See go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric for the official\nOpenTelemetry implementation of this API.\n\nAll measurements made with this package are made via instruments. These\ninstruments are created by a Meter which itself is created by a\nMeterProvider. Applications need to accept a MeterProvider implementation\nas a starting point when instrumenting. This can be done directly, or by using\nthe OpenTelemetry global MeterProvider via GetMeterProvider. Using an\nappropriately named Meter from the accepted MeterProvider, instrumentation\ncan then be built from the Meter's instruments.\n\nEach instrument is designed to make measurements of a particular type. Broadly,\nall instruments fall into two overlapping logical categories: asynchronous or\nsynchronous, and int64 or float64.\n\nAll synchronous instruments (Int64Counter, Int64UpDownCounter,\nInt64Histogram, Float64Counter, Float64UpDownCounter, and\nFloat64Histogram) are used to measure the operation and performance of source\ncode during the source code execution. These instruments only make measurements\nwhen the source code they instrument is run.\n\nAll asynchronous instruments (Int64ObservableCounter,\nInt64ObservableUpDownCounter, Int64ObservableGauge,\nFloat64ObservableCounter, Float64ObservableUpDownCounter, and\nFloat64ObservableGauge) are used to measure metrics outside of the execution\nof source code. They are said to make \"observations\" via a callback function\ncalled once every measurement collection cycle.\n\nEach instrument is also grouped by the value type it measures. Either int64 or\nfloat64. The value being measured will dictate which instrument in these\ncategories to use.\n\nOutside of these two broad categories, instruments are described by the\nfunction they are designed to serve. All Counters (Int64Counter,\nFloat64Counter, Int64ObservableCounter, and Float64ObservableCounter) are\ndesigned to measure values that never decrease in value, but instead only\nincrementally increase in value. UpDownCounters (Int64UpDownCounter,\nFloat64UpDownCounter, Int64ObservableUpDownCounter, and\nFloat64ObservableUpDownCounter) on the other hand, are designed to measure\nvalues that can increase and decrease. When more information needs to be\nconveyed about all the synchronous measurements made during a collection cycle,\na Histogram (Int64Histogram and Float64Histogram) should be used. Finally,\nwhen just the most recent measurement needs to be conveyed about an\nasynchronous measurement, a Gauge (Int64ObservableGauge and\nFloat64ObservableGauge) should be used.\n\nSee the OpenTelemetry documentation for more information about instruments\nand their intended use.\n\nOpenTelemetry defines an instrument name syntax that restricts what\ninstrument names are allowed.\n\nInstrument names should ...\n\nTo ensure compatibility with observability platforms, all instruments created\nneed to conform to this syntax. Not all implementations of the API will validate\nthese names, it is the callers responsibility to ensure compliance.\n\nMeasurements are made by recording values and information about the values with\nan instrument. How these measurements are recorded depends on the instrument.\n\nMeasurements for synchronous instruments (Int64Counter, Int64UpDownCounter,\nInt64Histogram, Float64Counter, Float64UpDownCounter, and\nFloat64Histogram) are recorded using the instrument methods directly. All\ncounter instruments have an Add method that is used to measure an increment\nvalue, and all histogram instruments have a Record method to measure a data\npoint.\n\nAsynchronous instruments (Int64ObservableCounter,\nInt64ObservableUpDownCounter, Int64ObservableGauge,\nFloat64ObservableCounter, Float64ObservableUpDownCounter, and\nFloat64ObservableGauge) record measurements within a callback function. The\ncallback is registered with the Meter which ensures the callback is called once\nper collection cycle. A callback can be registered two ways: during the\ninstrument's creation using an option, or later using the RegisterCallback\nmethod of the Meter that created the instrument.\n\nIf the following criteria are met, an option (WithInt64Callback or\nWithFloat64Callback) can be used during the asynchronous instrument's\ncreation to register a callback (Int64Callback or Float64Callback,\nrespectively):\n\nIf the criteria are not met, use the RegisterCallback method of the Meter that\ncreated the instrument to register a Callback.\n\nThis package does not conform to the standard Go versioning policy, all of its\ninterfaces may have methods added to them without a package major version bump.\nThis non-standard API evolution could surprise an uninformed implementation\nauthor. They could unknowingly build their implementation in a way that would\nresult in a runtime panic for their users that update to the new API.\n\nThe API is designed to help inform an instrumentation author about this\nnon-standard API evolution. It requires them to choose a default behavior for\nunimplemented interface methods. There are three behavior choices they can\nmake:\n\nAll interfaces in this API embed a corresponding interface from\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/embedded. If an author wants the default\nbehavior of their implementations to be a compilation failure, signaling to\ntheir users they need to update to the latest version of that implementation,\nthey need to embed the corresponding interface from\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/embedded in their implementation. For\nexample,\n\nIf an author wants the default behavior of their implementations to a panic,\nthey need to embed the API interface directly.\n\nThis is not a recommended behavior as it could lead to publishing packages that\ncontain runtime panics when users update other package that use newer versions\nof go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric.\n\nFinally, an author can embed another implementation in theirs.

The service also enables the client to fetch the user’s access token\nupon successful authentication and authorization with IAM Identity Center.\n\nIAM Identity Center uses the sso and identitystore API namespaces. IAM Identity\nCenter OpenID Connect uses the sso-oauth namespace.\n\nBefore you begin using this guide, we recommend that you first review the\nfollowing important information about how the IAM Identity Center OIDC service\nworks.\n\nThe IAM Identity Center OIDC service currently implements only the portions\nof the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant standard (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628 ) that are necessary to\nenable single sign-on authentication with the CLI.\n\nWith older versions of the CLI, the service only emits OIDC access tokens,\nso to obtain a new token, users must explicitly re-authenticate. To access the\nOIDC flow that supports token refresh and doesn’t require re-authentication,\nupdate to the latest CLI version (1.27.10 for CLI V1 and 2.9.0 for CLI V2) with\nsupport for OIDC token refresh and configurable IAM Identity Center session\ndurations. For more information, see Configure Amazon Web Services access portal session duration.\n\nThe access tokens provided by this service grant access to all Amazon Web\nServices account entitlements assigned to an IAM Identity Center user, not just\na particular application.\n\nThe documentation in this guide does not describe the mechanism to convert\nthe access token into Amazon Web Services Auth (“sigv4”) credentials for use\nwith IAM-protected Amazon Web Services service endpoints. For more information,\nsee GetRoleCredentialsin the IAM Identity Center Portal API Reference Guide.\n\nFor general information about IAM Identity Center, see What is IAM Identity Center? in the IAM Identity\nCenter User Guide.","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/ssooidc@v1.35.12","externalReferences":[{"url":"https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2","type":"website"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/ssooidc","type":"distribution"},{"url":"https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2","type":"vcs"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/ssooidc#section-documentation","type":"documentation"}],"properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:be504ffc809244f987d79757ccfa917313bd387192992494527bc745e8c05819"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:d956c9c5fe9e14a48e6d73ac97cea3df120fffbdb1219c77991ec45d76a41ef5"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/ssooidc@v1.35.12"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"},{"name":"ecosystems:first_release_published_at","value":"2020-09-29T01:40:02Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:latest_release_published_at","value":"2026-01-09T19:14:10Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:owner_location","value":"United States of America"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"aws"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"aws-sdk"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"go"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"golang"}]},{"bom-ref":"91054652-d8f1-45c1-972c-a149b4f5f0f1","type":"library","supplier":{"name":"OpenAPI Initiative golang toolkit"},"author":"OpenAPI Initiative golang toolkit","name":"github.com/go-openapi/validate","version":"v0.25.1","description":"Package validate provides methods to validate a swagger specification,\nas well as tools to validate data against their schema.\n\nThis package follows Swagger 2.0. specification (aka OpenAPI 2.0).

implements the WebSocket protocol defined in RFC 6455.\n\nThe Conn type represents a WebSocket connection. A server application calls\nthe Upgrader.Upgrade method from an HTTP request handler to get a *Conn:\n\nCall the connection's WriteMessage and ReadMessage methods to send and\nreceive messages as a slice of bytes. This snippet of code shows how to echo\nmessages using these methods:\n\nIn above snippet of code, p is a []byte and messageType is an int with value\nwebsocket.BinaryMessage or websocket.TextMessage.\n\nAn application can also send and receive messages using the io.WriteCloser\nand io.Reader interfaces. To send a message, call the connection NextWriter\nmethod to get an io.WriteCloser, write the message to the writer and close\nthe writer when done. To receive a message, call the connection NextReader\nmethod to get an io.Reader and read until io.EOF is returned. This snippet\nshows how to echo messages using the NextWriter and NextReader methods:\n\nThe WebSocket protocol distinguishes between text and binary data messages.\nText messages are interpreted as UTF-8 encoded text. The interpretation of\nbinary messages is left to the application.\n\nThis package uses the TextMessage and BinaryMessage integer constants to\nidentify the two data message types. The ReadMessage and NextReader methods\nreturn the type of the received message. The messageType argument to the\nWriteMessage and NextWriter methods specifies the type of a sent message.\n\nIt is the application's responsibility to ensure that text messages are\nvalid UTF-8 encoded text.\n\nThe WebSocket protocol defines three types of control messages: close, ping\nand pong. Call the connection WriteControl, WriteMessage or NextWriter\nmethods to send a control message to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received close messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetCloseHandler method and by returning a *CloseError from the\nNextReader, ReadMessage or the message Read method. The default close\nhandler sends a close message to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received ping messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetPingHandler method. The default ping handler sends a pong\nmessage to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received pong messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetPongHandler method. The default pong handler does nothing.\nIf an application sends ping messages, then the application should set a\npong handler to receive the corresponding pong.\n\nThe control message handler functions are called from the NextReader,\nReadMessage and message reader Read methods. The default close and ping\nhandlers can block these methods for a short time when the handler writes to\nthe connection.\n\nThe application must read the connection to process close, ping and pong\nmessages sent from the peer. If the application is not otherwise interested\nin messages from the peer, then the application should start a goroutine to\nread and discard messages from the peer. A simple example is:\n\nConnections support one concurrent reader and one concurrent writer.\n\nApplications are responsible for ensuring that no more than one goroutine\ncalls the write methods (NextWriter, SetWriteDeadline, WriteMessage,\nWriteJSON, EnableWriteCompression, SetCompressionLevel) concurrently and\nthat no more than one goroutine calls the read methods (NextReader,\nSetReadDeadline, ReadMessage, ReadJSON, SetPongHandler, SetPingHandler)\nconcurrently.\n\nThe Close and WriteControl methods can be called concurrently with all other\nmethods.\n\nWeb browsers allow Javascript applications to open a WebSocket connection to\nany host. It's up to the server to enforce an origin policy using the Origin\nrequest header sent by the browser.\n\nThe Upgrader calls the function specified in the CheckOrigin field to check\nthe origin. If the CheckOrigin function returns false, then the Upgrade\nmethod fails the WebSocket handshake with HTTP status 403.\n\nIf the CheckOrigin field is nil, then the Upgrader uses a safe default: fail\nthe handshake if the Origin request header is present and the Origin host is\nnot equal to the Host request header.\n\nThe deprecated package-level Upgrade function does not perform origin\nchecking. The application is responsible for checking the Origin header\nbefore calling the Upgrade function.\n\nConnections buffer network input and output to reduce the number\nof system calls when reading or writing messages.\n\nWrite buffers are also used for constructing WebSocket frames. See RFC 6455,\nSection 5 for a discussion of message framing. A WebSocket frame header is\nwritten to the network each time a write buffer is flushed to the network.\nDecreasing the size of the write buffer can increase the amount of framing\noverhead on the connection.\n\nThe buffer sizes in bytes are specified by the ReadBufferSize and\nWriteBufferSize fields in the Dialer and Upgrader. The Dialer uses a default\nsize of 4096 when a buffer size field is set to zero. The Upgrader reuses\nbuffers created by the HTTP server when a buffer size field is set to zero.\nThe HTTP server buffers have a size of 4096 at the time of this writing.\n\nThe buffer sizes do not limit the size of a message that can be read or\nwritten by a connection.\n\nBuffers are held for the lifetime of the connection by default. If the\nDialer or Upgrader WriteBufferPool field is set, then a connection holds the\nwrite buffer only when writing a message.\n\nApplications should tune the buffer sizes to balance memory use and\nperformance. Increasing the buffer size uses more memory, but can reduce the\nnumber of system calls to read or write the network. In the case of writing,\nincreasing the buffer size can reduce the number of frame headers written to\nthe network.\n\nSome guidelines for setting buffer parameters are:\n\nLimit the buffer sizes to the maximum expected message size. Buffers larger\nthan the largest message do not provide any benefit.\n\nDepending on the distribution of message sizes, setting the buffer size to\na value less than the maximum expected message size can greatly reduce memory\nuse with a small impact on performance. Here's an example: If 99% of the\nmessages are smaller than 256 bytes and the maximum message size is 512\nbytes, then a buffer size of 256 bytes will result in 1.01 more system calls\nthan a buffer size of 512 bytes. The memory savings is 50%.\n\nA write buffer pool is useful when the application has a modest number\nwrites over a large number of connections. when buffers are pooled, a larger\nbuffer size has a reduced impact on total memory use and has the benefit of\nreducing system calls and frame overhead.\n\nPer message compression extensions (RFC 7692) are experimentally supported\nby this package in a limited capacity. Setting the EnableCompression option\nto true in Dialer or Upgrader will attempt to negotiate per message deflate\nsupport.\n\nIf compression was successfully negotiated with the connection's peer, any\nmessage received in compressed form will be automatically decompressed.\nAll Read methods will return uncompressed bytes.\n\nPer message compression of messages written to a connection can be enabled\nor disabled by calling the corresponding Conn method:\n\nCurrently this package does not support compression with \"context takeover\".\nThis means that messages must be compressed and decompressed in isolation,\nwithout retaining sliding window or dictionary state across messages. For\nmore details refer to RFC 7692.\n\nUse of compression is experimental and may result in decreased performance.","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/gorilla/websocket@v1.5.4-0.20250319132907-e064f32e3674","externalReferences":[{"url":"https://github.com/gorilla/websocket","type":"website"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/websocket","type":"distribution"},{"url":"https://github.com/gorilla/websocket","type":"vcs"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/websocket#section-documentation","type":"documentation"}],"properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:6888b9d06e43a6f48204bacf65857d5f40325b0609ed22a5a2dcd8e849c74753"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:3dccafa3f67b159c6c51d6206d93d8ce98af27ac554918b926adc366bdaddf55"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"github.com/gorilla/websocket@v1.5.4-0.20250319132907-e064f32e3674"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"},{"name":"ecosystems:first_release_published_at","value":"2016-04-28T16:34:18Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:latest_release_published_at","value":"2024-06-14T03:18:03Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:owner_location","value":"The

the registry. The Digest type is\ndesigned to serve as a flexible identifier in a content-addressable system.\nMore importantly, it provides tools and wrappers to work with\nhash.Hash-based digests with little effort.\n\nThe format of a digest is simply a string with two parts, dubbed the\n\"algorithm\" and the \"digest\", separated by a colon:\n\nAn example of a sha256 digest representation follows:\n\nThe \"algorithm\" portion defines both the hashing algorithm used to calculate\nthe digest and the encoding of the resulting digest, which defaults to \"hex\"\nif not otherwise specified. Currently, all supported algorithms have their\ndigests encoded in hex strings.\n\nIn the example above, the string \"sha256\" is the algorithm and the hex bytes\nare the \"digest\".\n\nBecause the Digest type is simply a string, once a valid Digest is\nobtained, comparisons are cheap, quick and simple to express with the\nstandard equality operator.\n\nThe main benefit of using the Digest type is simple verification against a\ngiven digest. The Verifier interface, modeled after the stdlib hash.Hash\ninterface, provides a common write sink for digest verification. After\nwriting is complete, calling the Verifier.Verified method will indicate\nwhether or not the stream of bytes matches the target digest.\n\nIn addition to the above, we intend to add the following features to this\npackage:\n\n1.

The package allows\ncomplete control over what is sent out to the DNS. The API follows the\nless-is-more principle, by presenting a small, clean interface.\n\nIt supports (asynchronous) querying/replying, incoming/outgoing zone transfers,\nTSIG, EDNS0, dynamic updates, notifies and DNSSEC validation/signing.\n\nNote that domain names MUST be fully qualified before sending them, unqualified\nnames in a message will result in a packing failure.\n\nResource records are native types. They are not stored in wire format. Basic\nusage pattern for creating a new resource record:\n\nOr directly from a string:\n\nOr when the default origin (.) and TTL (3600) and class (IN) suit you:\n\nOr even:\n\nIn the DNS messages are exchanged, these messages contain resource records\n(sets). Use pattern for creating a message:\n\nOr when not certain if the domain name is fully qualified:\n\nThe message m is now a message with the question section set to ask the MX\nrecords for the miek.nl. zone.\n\nThe following is slightly more verbose, but more flexible:\n\nAfter creating a message it can be sent. Basic use pattern for synchronous\nquerying the DNS at a server configured on 127.0.0.1 and port 53:\n\nSuppressing multiple outstanding queries (with the same question, type and\nclass) is as easy as setting:\n\nMore advanced options are available using a net.Dialer and the corresponding API.\nFor example it is possible to set a timeout, or to specify a source IP address\nand port to use for the connection:\n\nIf these \"advanced\" features are not needed, a simple UDP query can be sent,\nwith:\n\nWhen this functions returns you will get DNS message. A DNS message consists\nout of four sections.\nThe question section: in.Question, the answer section: in.Answer,\nthe authority section: in.Ns and the additional section: in.Extra.\n\nEach of these sections (except the Question section) contain a []RR. Basic\nuse pattern for accessing the rdata of a TXT RR as the first RR in\nthe Answer section:\n\nBoth domain names and TXT character strings are converted to presentation form\nboth when unpacked and when converted to strings.\n\nFor TXT character strings, tabs, carriage returns and line feeds will be\nconverted to \\t, \\r and \\n respectively. Back slashes and quotations marks will\nbe escaped. Bytes below 32 and above 127 will be converted to \\DDD form.\n\nFor domain names, in addition to the above rules brackets, periods, spaces,\nsemicolons and the at symbol are escaped.\n\nDNSSEC (DNS Security Extension) adds a layer of security to the DNS. It uses\npublic key cryptography to sign resource records. The public keys are stored in\nDNSKEY records and the signatures in RRSIG records.\n\nRequesting DNSSEC information for a zone is done by adding the DO (DNSSEC OK)\nbit to a request.\n\nSignature generation, signature verification and key generation are all supported.\n\nDynamic updates reuses the DNS message format, but renames three of the\nsections. Question is Zone, Answer is Prerequisite, Authority is Update, only\nthe Additional is not renamed. See RFC 2136 for the gory details.\n\nYou can set a rather complex set of rules for the existence of absence of\ncertain resource records or names in a zone to specify if resource records\nshould be added or removed. The table from RFC 2136 supplemented with the Go\nDNS function shows which functions exist to specify the prerequisites.\n\nThe prerequisite section can also be left empty. If you have decided on the\nprerequisites you can tell what RRs should be added or deleted. The next table\nshows the options you have and what functions to call.\n\nAn TSIG or transaction signature adds a HMAC TSIG record to each message sent.\nThe supported algorithms include: HmacSHA1, HmacSHA256 and HmacSHA512.\n\nBasic use pattern when querying with a TSIG name \"axfr.\" (note that these key names\nmust be fully qualified - as they are domain names) and the base64 secret\n\"so6ZGir4GPAqINNh9U5c3A==\":\n\nIf an incoming message contains a TSIG record it MUST be the last record in\nthe additional section (RFC2845 3.2).  This means that you should make the\ncall to SetTsig last, right before executing the query.  If you make any\nchanges to the RRset after calling SetTsig() the signature will be incorrect.\n\nWhen requesting an zone transfer (almost all TSIG usage is when requesting zone\ntransfers), with TSIG, this is the basic use pattern. In this example we\nrequest an AXFR for miek.nl. with TSIG key named \"axfr.\" and secret\n\"so6ZGir4GPAqINNh9U5c3A==\" and using the server 176.58.119.54:\n\nYou can now read the records from the transfer as they come in. Each envelope\nis checked with TSIG. If something is not correct an error is returned.\n\nA custom TSIG implementation can be used. This requires additional code to\nperform any session establishment and signature generation/verification. The\nclient must be configured with an implementation of the TsigProvider interface:\n\nBasic use pattern validating and replying to a message that has TSIG set.\n\nRFC 6895 sets aside a range of type codes for private use. This range is 65,280\n- 65,534 (0xFF00 - 0xFFFE). When experimenting with new Resource Records these\ncan be used, before requesting an official type code from IANA.\n\nSee https://miek.nl/2014/september/21/idn-and-private-rr-in-go-dns/ for more\ninformation.\n\nEDNS0 is an extension mechanism for the DNS defined in RFC 2671 and updated by\nRFC 6891. It defines a new RR type, the OPT RR, which is then completely\nabused.\n\nBasic use pattern for creating an (empty) OPT RR:\n\nThe rdata of an OPT RR consists out of a slice of EDNS0 (RFC 6891) interfaces.\nCurrently only a few have been standardized: EDNS0_NSID (RFC 5001) and\nEDNS0_SUBNET (RFC 7871).

- CNCF","url":["https://opentelemetry.io"]},"author":"OpenTelemetry - CNCF","name":"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace","version":"v1.39.0","description":"Package trace provides an implementation of the tracing part of the\nOpenTelemetry API.\n\nTo participate in distributed traces a Span needs to be created for the\noperation being performed as part of a traced workflow. In its simplest form:\n\nA Tracer is unique to the instrumentation and is used to create Spans.\nInstrumentation should be designed to accept a TracerProvider from which it\ncan create its own unique Tracer. Alternatively, the registered global\nTracerProvider from the go.opentelemetry.io/otel package can be used as\na default.\n\nThis package does not conform to the standard Go versioning policy; all of its\ninterfaces may have methods added to them without a package major version bump.\nThis non-standard API evolution could surprise an uninformed implementation\nauthor. They could unknowingly build their implementation in a way that would\nresult in a runtime panic for their users that update to the new API.\n\nThe API is designed to help inform an instrumentation author about this\nnon-standard API evolution. It requires them to choose a default behavior for\nunimplemented interface methods. There are three behavior choices they can\nmake:\n\nAll interfaces in this API embed a corresponding interface from\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace/embedded. If an author wants the default\nbehavior of their implementations to be a compilation failure, signaling to\ntheir users they need to update to the latest version of that implementation,\nthey need to embed the corresponding interface from\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace/embedded in their implementation. For\nexample,\n\nIf an author wants the default behavior of their implementations to panic, they\ncan embed the API interface directly.\n\nThis option is not recommended. It will lead to publishing packages that\ncontain runtime panics when users update to newer versions of\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace, which may be done with a transitive\ndependency.\n\nFinally, an author can embed another implementation in theirs. The embedded\nimplementation will be used for methods not defined by the author. For example,\nan author who wants to default to silently dropping the call can use\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace/noop:\n\nIt is strongly recommended that authors only

logr defines a general-purpose logging API and abstract interfaces\nto back that API.  Packages in the Go ecosystem can depend on this package,\nwhile callers can implement logging with whatever backend is appropriate.\n\nLogging is done using a Logger instance.  Logger is a concrete type with\nmethods, which defers the actual logging to a LogSink interface.  The main\nmethods of Logger are Info() and Error().  Arguments to Info() and Error()\nare key/value pairs rather than printf-style formatted strings, emphasizing\n\"structured logging\".\n\nWith Go's standard log package, we might write:\n\nWith logr's structured logging, we'd write:\n\nErrors are much the same.  Instead of:\n\nWe'd write:\n\nInfo() and Error() are very similar, but they are separate methods so that\nLogSink implementations can choose to do things like attach additional\ninformation (such as stack traces) on calls to Error(). Error() messages are\nalways logged, regardless of the current verbosity.  If there is no error\ninstance available, passing nil is valid.\n\nOften we want to log information only when the application in \"verbose\nmode\".  To write log lines that are more verbose, Logger has a V() method.\nThe higher the V-level of a log line, the less critical it is considered.\nLog-lines with V-levels that are not enabled (as per the LogSink) will not\nbe written.  Level V(0) is the default, and logger.V(0).Info() has the same\nmeaning as logger.Info().  Negative V-levels have the same meaning as V(0).\nError messages do not have a verbosity level and are always logged.\n\nWhere we might have written:\n\nWe can write:\n\nLogger instances can have name strings so that all messages logged through\nthat instance have additional context.  For example, you might want to add\na subsystem name:\n\nThe WithName() method returns a new Logger, which can be passed to\nconstructors or other functions for further use.  Repeated use of WithName()\nwill accumulate name \"segments\".  These name segments will be joined in some\nway by the LogSink implementation.  It is strongly recommended that name\nsegments contain simple identifiers (letters, digits, and hyphen), and do\nnot contain characters that could muddle the log output or confuse the\njoining operation (e.g. whitespace, commas, periods, slashes, brackets,\nquotes, etc).\n\nLogger instances can store any number of key/value pairs, which will be\nlogged alongside all messages logged through that instance.  For example,\nyou might want to create a Logger instance per managed object:\n\nWith the standard log package, we might write:\n\nWith logr we'd write:\n\nLogger has very few hard rules, with the goal that LogSink implementations\nmight have a lot of freedom to differentiate.  There are, however, some\nthings to consider.\n\nThe log message consists of a constant message attached to the log line.\nThis should generally be a simple description of what's occurring, and should\nnever be a format string.  Variable information can then be attached using\nnamed values.\n\nKeys are arbitrary strings, but should generally be constant values.  Values\nmay be any Go value, but how the value is formatted is determined by the\nLogSink implementation.\n\nLogger instances are meant to be passed around by value. Code that receives\nsuch a value can call its methods without having to check whether the\ninstance is ready for use.\n\nThe zero logger (= Logger{}) is identical to Discard() and discards all log\nentries. Code that receives a Logger by value can simply call it, the methods\nwill never crash. For cases where passing a logger is optional, a pointer to Logger\nshould be used.\n\nKeys are not strictly required to conform to any specification or regex, but\nit is recommended that they:\n\nThese guidelines help ensure that log data is processed properly regardless\nof the log implementation.  For example, log implementations will try to\noutput JSON data or will store data for later database (e.g. SQL) queries.\n\nWhile users are generally free to use key names of their choice, it's\ngenerally best to avoid using the following keys, as they're frequently used\nby implementations:\n\nImplementations are encouraged to make use of these keys to represent the\nabove concepts, when necessary (for example, in a pure-JSON output form, it\nwould be necessary to represent at least message and timestamp as ordinary\nnamed values).\n\nImplementations may choose to give callers access to the underlying\nlogging implementation.  The recommended pattern for this is:\n\nLogger grants access to the sink to enable type assertions like this:\n\nCustom `With*` functions can be implemented by copying the complete\nLogger struct and replacing the sink in the copy:\n\nDon't use New to construct a new Logger with a LogSink retrieved from an\nexisting Logger. Source code attribution might not work correctly and\nunexported fields in Logger get lost.\n\nBeware that the same LogSink instance may be shared by different logger\ninstances. Calling functions that modify the LogSink will affect all of\nthose.","licenses":[{"expression":"(Apache-2.0)"}],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/go-logr/logr@v1.4.3","externalReferences":[{"url":"https://github.com/go-logr/logr","type":"website"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-logr/logr","type":"distribution"},{"url":"https://github.com/go-logr/logr","type":"vcs"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-logr/logr#section-documentation","type":"documentation"}],"properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:be504ffc809244f987d79757ccfa917313bd387192992494527bc745e8c05819"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:d956c9c5fe9e14a48e6d73ac97cea3df120fffbdb1219c77991ec45d76a41ef5"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"github.com/go-logr/logr@v1.4.3"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"},{"name":"ecosystems:first_release_published_at","value":"2018-06-29T23:58:05Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:latest_release_published_at","value":"2025-05-19T04:56:57Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"logger"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"logging"}]},{"bom-ref":"ab59987a-b695-48c3-a253-6a77131c006f","type":"library","supplier":{"name":"Evan Shaw"},"author":"Evan Shaw","name":"github.com/edsrzf/mmap-go","version":"v1.2.0","description":"Package mmap allows mapping files into memory.

For more information\nabout this property, see https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html\nor any book about automata theory.\n\nAll characters are UTF-8-encoded code points.\nFollowing utf8.DecodeRune, each byte of an invalid UTF-8 sequence\nis treated as if it encoded utf8.RuneError (U+FFFD).\n\nThere are 16 methods of Regexp that match a regular expression and identify\nthe matched text. Their names are matched by this regular expression:\n\nIf 'All' is present, the routine matches successive non-overlapping\nmatches of the entire expression. Empty matches abutting a preceding\nmatch are ignored. The return value is a slice containing the successive\nreturn values of the corresponding non-'All' routine. These routines take\nan extra integer argument, n. If n \u003e= 0, the function returns at most n\nmatches/submatches; otherwise, it returns all of them.\n\nIf 'String' is present, the argument is a string; otherwise it is a slice\nof bytes; return values are adjusted as appropriate.\n\nIf 'Submatch' is present, the return value is a slice identifying the\nsuccessive submatches of the expression. Submatches are matches of\nparenthesized subexpressions (also known as capturing groups) within the\nregular expression, numbered from left to right in order of opening\nparenthesis. Submatch 0 is the match of the entire expression, submatch 1 is\nthe match of the first parenthesized subexpression, and so on.\n\nIf 'Index' is present, matches and submatches are identified by byte index\npairs within the input string: result[2*n:2*n+2] identifies the indexes of\nthe nth submatch. The pair for n==0 identifies the match of the entire\nexpression. If 'Index' is not present, the match is identified by the text\nof the match/submatch.

expression search.\n\nThe syntax of the regular expressions accepted is the same\ngeneral syntax used by Perl, Python, and other languages.\nMore precisely, it is the syntax accepted by RE2 and described at\nhttps://golang.org/s/re2syntax, except for \\C.\nFor an overview of the syntax, see the regexp/syntax package.\n\nThe regexp implementation provided by this package is\nguaranteed to run in time linear in the size of the input.\n(This is a property not guaranteed by most open source\nimplementations of regular expressions.) For more information\nabout this property, see https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html\nor any book about automata theory.\n\nAll characters are UTF-8-encoded code points.\nFollowing utf8.DecodeRune, each byte of an invalid UTF-8 sequence\nis treated as if it encoded utf8.RuneError (U+FFFD).\n\nThere are 16 methods of Regexp that match a regular expression and identify\nthe matched text. Their names are matched by this regular expression:\n\nIf 'All' is present, the routine matches successive non-overlapping\nmatches of the entire expression. Empty matches abutting a preceding\nmatch are ignored. The return value is a slice containing the successive\nreturn values of the corresponding non-'All' routine. These routines take\nan extra integer argument, n. If n \u003e= 0, the function returns at most n\nmatches/submatches; otherwise, it returns all of them.\n\nIf 'String' is present, the argument is a string; otherwise it is a slice\nof bytes; return values are adjusted as appropriate.\n\nIf 'Submatch' is present, the return value is a slice identifying the\nsuccessive submatches of the expression. Submatches are matches of\nparenthesized subexpressions (also known as capturing groups) within the\nregular expression, numbered from left to right in order of opening\nparenthesis. Submatch 0 is the match of the entire expression, submatch 1 is\nthe match of the first parenthesized subexpression, and so on.\n\nIf 'Index' is present, matches and submatches are identified by byte index\npairs within the input string: result[2*n:2*n+2] identifies the indexes of\nthe nth submatch. The pair for n==0 identifies the match of the entire\nexpression. If 'Index' is not present, the match is identified by the text\nof the match/submatch. If an index is negative or text is nil, it means that\nsubexpression did not match any string in the input. For 'String' versions\nan empty string means either no match or an empty match.\n\nThere is also a subset of the methods that can be applied to text read from\nan io.RuneReader: Regexp.MatchReader, Regexp.FindReaderIndex,\nRegexp.FindReaderSubmatchIndex.\n\nThis set may grow. Note that regular expression matches may need to\nexamine text beyond the text returned by a match, so the methods that\nmatch text from an io.RuneReader may read arbitrarily far into the input\nbefore returning.\n\n(There are a few other methods that do not match this pattern.)","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/grafana/regexp@v0.0.0-20250905093917-f7b3be9d1853","externalReferences":[{"url":"https://github.com/grafana/regexp","type":"website"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/grafana/regexp","type":"distribution"},{"url":"https://github.com/grafana/regexp","type":"vcs"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/grafana/regexp#section-documentation","type":"documentation"}],"properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:6888b9d06e43a6f48204bacf65857d5f40325b0609ed22a5a2dcd8e849c74753"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:3dccafa3f67b159c6c51d6206d93d8ce98af27ac554918b926adc366bdaddf55"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"github.com/grafana/regexp@v0.0.0-20250905093917-f7b3be9d1853"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"},{"name":"ecosystems:first_release_published_at","value":"2022-03-04T09:56:17Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:latest_release_published_at","value":"2022-11-23T15:37:39Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:owner_location","value":"Sweden"}]},{"bom-ref":"d16fb2a3-4a33-438e-bd6c-d8b4e5594c91","type":"library","supplier":{"name":"Prometheus","url":["https://prometheus.io"]},"author":"Prometheus","name":"github.com/prometheus/client_golang","version":"v1.23.2","licenses":[{"expression":"(Apache-2.0)"}],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/prometheus/client_golang@v1.23.2","externalReferences":[{"url":"https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang","type":"website"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/prometheus/client_golang","type":"distribution"},{"url":"https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang","type":"vcs"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/prometheus/client_golang#section-documentation","type":"documentation"}],"properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:be504ffc809244f987d79757ccfa917313bd387192992494527bc745e8c05819"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:d956c9c5fe9e14a48e6d73ac97cea3df120fffbdb1219c77991ec45d76a41ef5"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"github.com/prometheus/client_golang@v1.23.2"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"},{"name":"ecosystems:first_release_published_at","value":"2016-08-17T15:48:24Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:latest_release_published_at","value":"2025-09-05T14:03:59Z"}]},{"bom-ref":"d207df53-2659-4687-9ffd-0e56064850d0","type":"library","supplier":{"name":"gophercloud"},"author":"gophercloud","name":"github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud/v2","version":"v2.9.0","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud/v2@v2.9.0","externalReferences":[{"url":"https://github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud","type":"website"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud/v2","type":"distribution"},{"url":"https://github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud","type":"vcs"},{"url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud/v2#section-documentation","type":"documentation"}],"properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:6888b9d06e43a6f48204bacf65857d5f40325b0609ed22a5a2dcd8e849c74753"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:3dccafa3f67b159c6c51d6206d93d8ce98af27ac554918b926adc366bdaddf55"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud/v2@v2.9.0"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"},{"name":"ecosystems:first_release_published_at","value":"2024-02-08T14:49:12Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:latest_release_published_at","value":"2025-11-17T14:29:40Z"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"go"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"openstack"},{"name":"ecosystems:topic","value":"sdk"}]},{"bom-ref":"d269212b-c80a-4bbc-9e75-9f84a0d8edc8","type":"library","name":"github.com/hashicorp/cronexpr","version":"v1.1.3","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/hashicorp/cronexpr@v1.1.3","properties":[{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDiffID","value":"sha256:be504ffc809244f987d79757ccfa917313bd387192992494527bc745e8c05819"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:LayerDigest","value":"sha256:d956c9c5fe9e14a48e6d73ac97cea3df120fffbdb1219c77991ec45d76a41ef5"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgID","value":"github.com/hashicorp/cronexpr@v1.1.3"},{"name":"aquasecurity:trivy:PkgType","value":"gobinary"}]},{"bom-ref":"d26d12c6-d3f3-406c-a021-7bc3abc73690","type":"library","supplier":{"name":"Alec

an HTTP request/response middleware pipeline used by Azure SDK clients.\n\nThe middleware consists of three components.\n\nA Policy can be implemented in two ways; as a first-class function for a stateless Policy, or as\na method on a type for a stateful Policy.  Note that HTTP requests made via the same pipeline share\nthe same Policy instances, so if a Policy mutates its state it MUST be properly synchronized to\navoid race conditions.\n\nA Policy's Do method is called when an HTTP request wants to be sent over the network. The Do method can\nperform any operation(s) it desires. For example, it can log the outgoing request, mutate the URL, headers,\nand/or query parameters, inject a failure, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its request\nwork, it must call the Next() method on the *policy.Request instance in order to pass the request to the\nnext Policy in the chain.\n\nWhen an HTTP response comes back, the Policy then gets a chance to process the response/error.  The Policy instance\ncan log the response, retry the operation if it failed due to a transient error or timeout, unmarshal the response\nbody, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its response work, it must return the *http.Response\nand error instances to its caller.\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateless Policy:\n\nTemplate for implementing a stateful Policy:\n\nThe Transporter interface is responsible for sending the HTTP request and returning the corresponding\nHTTP response or error.  The Transporter is invoked by the last Policy in the chain.  The default Transporter\nimplementation uses a shared http.Client from the standard library.\n\nThe same stateful/stateless rules for Policy implementations apply to Transporter implementations.\n\nTo use the Policy and Transporter instances, an application passes them to the runtime.NewPipeline function.\n\nThe specified Policy instances form a chain and are invoked in the order provided to NewPipeline\nfollowed by the Transporter.\n\nOnce the Pipeline has been created, create a runtime.Request instance and pass it to Pipeline's Do method.\n\nThe Pipeline.Do method sends the specified Request through the chain of Policy and Transporter\ninstances.  The response/error is then sent through the same chain of Policy instances in reverse\norder.  For example, assuming there are Policy types PolicyA, PolicyB, and PolicyC along with\nTransportA.\n\nThe flow of Request and Response looks like the following:\n\nThe Request instance passed to Pipeline's Do method is a wrapper around an *http.Request.  It also\ncontains some internal state and provides various convenience methods.  You create a Request instance\nby calling the runtime.NewRequest function:\n\nIf the Request should contain a body, call the SetBody method.\n\nA seekable stream is required so that upon retry, the retry Policy instance can seek the stream\nback to the beginning before retrying the network request and re-uploading the body.\n\nOperations like JSON-MERGE-PATCH send a JSON null to indicate a value should be deleted.\n\nThis requirement conflicts with the SDK's default marshalling that specifies \"omitempty\" as\na means to resolve the ambiguity between a field to be excluded and its zero-value.\n\nIn the above example, Name and Count are defined as pointer-to-type to disambiguate between\na missing value (nil) and a zero-value (0) which might have semantic differences.\n\nIn a PATCH operation, any fields left as nil are to have their values preserved.  When updating\na Widget's count, one simply specifies the new value for Count, leaving Name nil.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement for sending a JSON null, the NullValue() function can be used.\n\nThis sends an explict \"null\" for Count, indicating that any current value for Count should be deleted.\n\nWhen the HTTP response is received, the *http.Response is returned directly. Each Policy instance\ncan inspect/mutate the *http.Response.\n\nTo enable logging, set environment variable AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING to \"all\" before executing your program.\n\nBy default the logger writes to stderr.  This can be customized by calling log.SetListener, providing\na callback that writes to the desired location.  Any custom logging implementation MUST provide its\nown synchronization to handle concurrent invocations.\n\nSee the docs for the log package for further details.\n\nPageable operations return potentially large data sets spread over multiple GET requests.  The result of\neach GET is a \"page\" of data consisting of a slice of items.\n\nPageable operations can be identified by their New*Pager naming convention and return type of *runtime.Pager[T].\n\nThe call to WidgetClient.NewListWidgetsPager() returns an instance of *runtime.Pager[T] for fetching pages\nand determining if there are more pages to fetch.  No IO calls are made until the NextPage() method is invoked.\n\nLong-running operations (LROs) are operations consisting of an initial request to start the operation followed\nby polling to determine when the operation has reached a terminal state.  An LRO's terminal state is one\nof the following values.\n\nLROs can be identified by their Begin* prefix and their return type of *runtime.Poller[T].\n\nWhen a call to WidgetClient.BeginCreateOrUpdate() returns a nil error, it means that the LRO has started.\nIt does _not_ mean that the widget has been created or updated (or failed to be created/updated).\n\nThe *runtime.Poller[T] provides APIs for determining the state of the LRO.  To wait for the LRO to complete,\ncall the PollUntilDone() method.\n\nThe call to PollUntilDone() will block the current goroutine until the LRO has reached a terminal state or the\ncontext is canceled/timed out.\n\nNote that LROs can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  The duration is operation-dependent.  Due to\nthis variant behavior, pollers do _not_ have a preconfigured time-out.  Use a context with the appropriate cancellation\nmechanism as required.\n\nPollers provide the ability to serialize their state into a \"resume token\" which can be used by another process to\nrecreate the poller.  This is achieved via the runtime.Poller[T].ResumeToken() method.\n\nNote that a token can only be obtained for a poller that's in a non-terminal state.  Also note that any subsequent calls\nto poller.Poll() might change the poller's state.  In this case, a new token should be created.\n\nAfter the token has been obtained, it can be used to recreate an instance of the originating poller.\n\nWhen resuming a poller, no IO is performed, and zero-value arguments can be used for everything but the Options.ResumeToken.\n\nResume tokens are unique per service client and operation.  Attempting to resume a poller for LRO BeginB() with a token from LRO\nBeginA() will result in an error.\n\nThe fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.\nThis allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.\n\nPlease see

It provides\na standard set of clients and tools for building applications, controllers,\nand operators that communicate with a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nkubernetes: Contains the typed Clientset for interacting with built-in,\nversioned API objects (e.g., Pods, Deployments). This is the most common\nstarting point.\n\ndynamic: Provides a dynamic client that can perform operations on any\nKubernetes object, including Custom Resources (CRs). It is essential for\nbuilding controllers that work with CRDs.\n\ndiscovery: Used to discover the API groups, versions, and resources\nsupported by a Kubernetes cluster.\n\ntools/cache: The foundation of the controller pattern. This package provides\nefficient caching and synchronization mechanisms (Informers and Listers)\nfor building controllers.\n\ntools/clientcmd: Provides methods for loading client configuration from\nkubeconfig files. This is essential for out-of-cluster applications and CLI tools.\n\nrest: Provides a lower-level RESTClient that manages the details of\ncommunicating with the Kubernetes API server. It is useful for advanced\nuse cases that require fine-grained control over requests, such as working\nwith non-standard REST verbs.\n\nThere are two primary ways to configure a client to connect to the API server:\n\nIn-Cluster Configuration: For applications running inside a Kubernetes pod,\nthe `rest.InClusterConfig()` function provides a straightforward way to\nconfigure the client. It automatically uses the pod's service account for\nauthentication and is the recommended approach for controllers and operators.\n\nOut-of-Cluster Configuration: For local development or command-line tools,\nthe `clientcmd` package is used to load configuration from a\nkubeconfig file.\n\nThe `rest.Config` object allows for fine-grained control over client-side\nperformance and reliability. Key settings include:\n\nOnce configured, a client can be used to interact with objects in the cluster.\n\nThe Typed Clientset (`kubernetes` package) provides a strongly typed\ninterface for working with built-in Kubernetes objects.\n\nThe Dynamic Client (`dynamic` package) can work with any object, including\nCustom Resources, using `unstructured.Unstructured` types.\n\nFor Custom Resources (CRDs), the `k8s.io/code-generator` repository\ncontains the tools to generate typed clients, informers, and listers. The\n`sample-controller` is the canonical example of this pattern.\n\nServer-Side Apply is a patching strategy that allows multiple actors to\nshare management of an object by tracking field ownership. This prevents\nactors from inadvertently overwriting each other's changes and provides\na mechanism for resolving conflicts. The `applyconfigurations` package\nprovides the necessary tools for this declarative approach.\n\nRobust error handling is essential when interacting with the API. The\n`k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/api/errors` package provides functions to inspect\nerrors and check for common conditions, such as whether a resource was not\nfound or already exists. This allows controllers to implement robust,\nidempotent reconciliation logic.\n\nThe controller pattern is central to Kubernetes. A controller observes the\nstate of the cluster and works to bring it to the desired state.\n\nThe `tools/cache` package provides the building blocks for this pattern.\nInformers watch the API server and maintain a local cache, Listers provide\nread-only access to the cache, and Workqueues decouple event detection\nfrom processing.\n\nIn a high-availability deployment where multiple instances of a controller\nare running, leader election (`tools/leaderelection`) is used to ensure\nthat only one instance is active at a time.\n\nClient-side feature gates allow for enabling or disabling experimental\nfeatures in `client-go`.

(https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax)\nThis feature requires the use of a CurlyRouter.\n\n### Containers\n\nA Container holds a collection of WebServices, Filters and a http.ServeMux for multiplexing http requests.\nUsing the statements \"restful.Add(...) and restful.Filter(...)\" will register WebServices and Filters to the Default Container.\nThe Default container of go-restful uses the http.DefaultServeMux.\nYou can create your own Container and create a new http.Server for that particular container.\n\n### Filters\n\nA filter dynamically intercepts requests and responses to transform or use the information contained in the requests or responses.\nYou can use filters to perform generic logging, measurement, authentication, redirect, set response headers etc.\nIn the restful package there are three hooks into the request,response flow where filters can be added.\nEach filter must define a FilterFunction:\n\nUse the following statement to pass the request,response pair to the next filter or RouteFunction\n\n### Container Filters\n\nThese are processed before any registered WebService.\n\n### WebService Filters\n\nThese are processed before any Route of a WebService.\n\n### Route Filters\n\nThese are processed before calling the function associated with the Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/filters/restful-filters.go with full implementations.\n\n### Response Encoding\n\nTwo encodings are supported: gzip and deflate. To enable this for all responses:\n\nIf a Http request includes the Accept-Encoding header then the response content will be compressed using the specified encoding.\nAlternatively, you can create a Filter that performs the encoding and install it per WebService or Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/encoding/restful-encoding-filter.go\n\n### OPTIONS support\n\nBy installing a pre-defined container filter, your Webservice(s) can respond to the OPTIONS Http request.\n\n### CORS\n\nBy installing the filter of a CrossOriginResourceSharing (CORS), your WebService(s) can handle CORS requests.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nUnexpected things happen. If a request cannot be processed because of a failure, your service needs to tell via the response what happened and why.\nFor this reason HTTP status codes exist and it is important to use the correct code in every exceptional situation.\n\nIf path or query parameters are not valid (content or type) then use http.StatusBadRequest.\n\nDespite a valid URI, the resource requested may not be available\n\nIf the application logic could not process the request (or write the response) then use http.StatusInternalServerError.\n\nThe request has a valid URL but the method (GET,PUT,POST,...) is not allowed.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Accept Header set for this operation.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Content-Type Header set for this operation.\n\n### ServiceError\n\nIn addition to setting the correct (error) Http status code, you can choose to write a ServiceError message on the response.\n\n### Performance options\n\nThis package has several options that affect the performance of your service. It is important to understand them and how you can change it.\n\nDoNotRecover controls whether panics will be caught to return HTTP 500.\nIf set to false, the container will recover from panics.\nDefault value is true\n\nIf content encoding is enabled then the default strategy for getting new gzip/zlib writers and readers is to use a sync.Pool.\nBecause writers are expensive structures, performance is even more improved when using a preloaded cache. You can also inject your own implementation.\n\n### Trouble shooting\n\nThis package has the means to produce detail logging of the complete Http request matching process and filter invocation.\nEnabling this feature requires you to set an implementation of restful.StdLogger (e.g. log.Logger) instance such as:\n\n### Logging\n\nThe restful.SetLogger() method allows you to override the logger used by the package. By default restful\nuses the standard library `log` package and logs to stdout. Different logging packages are supported as\nlong as they conform to `StdLogger` interface defined in the `log` sub-package, writing an adapter for your\npreferred package is simple.\n\n### Resources\n\n(c) 2012-2025, http://ernestmicklei.com.

Below are some\nexamples to create custom color objects and use the print functions of each\nseparate color object.\n\nYou can create PrintXxx functions to simplify even more:\n\nYou can also FprintXxx functions to pass your own io.Writer:\n\nOr create SprintXxx functions to mix strings with other non-colorized strings:\n\nWindows support is enabled by default. All Print functions work as intended.\nHowever, only for color.SprintXXX functions, user should use fmt.FprintXXX and\nset the output to color.Output:\n\nUsing with existing code is possible. Just use the Set() method to set the\nstandard output to the given parameters. That way a rewrite of an existing\ncode is not required.\n\nThere might be a case where you want to disable color output (for example to\npipe the standard output of your app to somewhere else). `Color` has support to\ndisable colors both globally and for single color definition.

See https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/api for a full list of\nsub-packages.\n\nWithin api there exist numerous clients which connect to Google APIs,\nand various utility packages.\n\nAll clients in sub-packages are configurable via client options. These\noptions are described here: https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/api/option.\n\nAll the clients in sub-packages support authentication via Google\nApplication Default Credentials (see\nhttps://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production), or by providing a\nJSON key file for a Service Account. See the authentication examples in\nhttps://godoc.org/google.golang.org/api/transport for more details.\n\nDue to the auto-generated nature of this collection of libraries, complete\nAPIs or specific versions can appear or go away without notice. As a result,\nyou should always locally vendor any API(s) that your code relies upon.\n\nGoogle APIs follow semver as specified by\nhttps://cloud.google.com/apis/design/versioning. The code generator and\nthe code it produces - the libraries in the google.golang.org/api/...\nsubpackages - are beta.\n\nNote that versioning and stability is strictly not communicated through Go\nmodules. Go modules are used only for dependency management.\n\nMany parameters are specified using ints. However, underlying APIs might\noperate on a finer granularity, expecting int64, int32, uint64, or uint32,\nall of whom have different maximum values. Subsequently, specifying an int\nparameter in one of these clients may result in an error from the API\nbecause the value is too large.\n\nTo see the exact type of int that the API expects, you can inspect the API's\ndiscovery doc. A global catalogue pointing to the discovery doc of APIs can\nbe found at https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis.\n\nThis field can be found on all Request/Response structs in the generated\nclients. All of these types have the JSON `omitempty` field tag present on\ntheir fields. This means if a type is set to its default value it will not be\nmarshalled. Sometimes you may actually want to send a default value, for\ninstance sending an int of `0`. In this case you can override the `omitempty`\nfeature by adding the field name to the `ForceSendFields` slice. See docs on\nany struct for more details. This may be used to include empty fields in\nPatch requests.\n\nThis field can be found on all Request/Response structs in the generated\nclients. It can be be used to send JSON null values for the listed fields.\nBy default, fields with empty values are omitted from API requests because of\nthe presence of the `omitempty` field tag on all fields. However, any field\nwith an empty value appearing in NullFields will be sent to the server as\nnull. It is an error if a field in this list has a non-empty value. This may\nbe used to include null fields in Patch requests.\n\nAn error returned by a client's Do method may be cast to a *googleapi.Error\nor unwrapped to an *apierror.APIError.\n\nThe https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/googleapi#Error type is useful\nfor getting the HTTP status code:\n\nThe https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/googleapis/gax-go/v2/apierror#APIError type\nis useful for inspecting structured details of the underlying API response,\nsuch as the reason for the error and the error domain, which is typically the\nregistered service name of the tool or product that generated the error:\n\nIf an API call returns an Operation, that means it could take some time to\ncomplete the work initiated by the API call.

Put differently, using json.Marshal and\nfmt.Fprintf to log tons of interface{} makes your application slow.\n\nZap takes a different approach. It includes a reflection-free,\nzero-allocation JSON encoder, and the base Logger strives to avoid\nserialization overhead and allocations wherever possible. By building the\nhigh-level SugaredLogger on that foundation, zap lets users choose when\nthey need to count every allocation and when they'd prefer a more familiar,\nloosely typed API.\n\nIn contexts where performance is nice, but not critical, use the\nSugaredLogger. It's 4-10x faster than other structured logging packages and\nsupports both structured and printf-style logging. Like log15 and go-kit,\nthe SugaredLogger's structured logging APIs are loosely typed and accept a\nvariadic number of key-value pairs. (For more advanced use cases, they also\naccept strongly typed fields - see the SugaredLogger.With documentation for\ndetails.)\n\nBy default, loggers are unbuffered. However, since zap's low-level APIs\nallow buffering, calling Sync before letting your process exit is a good\nhabit.\n\nIn the rare contexts where every microsecond and every allocation matter,\nuse the Logger. It's even faster than the SugaredLogger and allocates far\nless, but it only supports strongly-typed, structured logging.\n\nChoosing between the Logger and SugaredLogger doesn't need to be an\napplication-wide decision: converting between the two is simple and\ninexpensive.\n\nThe simplest way to build a Logger is to use zap's opinionated presets:\nNewExample, NewProduction, and NewDevelopment. These presets build a logger\nwith a single function call:\n\nPresets are fine for small projects, but larger projects and organizations\nnaturally require a bit more customization. For most users, zap's Config\nstruct strikes the right balance between flexibility and convenience. See\nthe package-level BasicConfiguration example for sample code.\n\nMore unusual configurations (splitting output between files, sending logs\nto a message queue, etc.) are possible, but require direct use of\ngo.uber.org/zap/zapcore. See the package-level AdvancedConfiguration\nexample for sample code.\n\nThe zap package itself is a relatively thin wrapper around the interfaces\nin go.uber.org/zap/zapcore. Extending zap to support a new encoding (e.g.,\nBSON), a new log sink (e.g., Kafka), or something more exotic (perhaps an\nexception aggregation service, like Sentry or Rollbar) typically requires\nimplementing the zapcore.Encoder, zapcore.WriteSyncer, or zapcore.Core\ninterfaces. See the zapcore documentation for details.\n\nSimilarly, package authors can use the high-performance Encoder and Core\nimplementations in the zapcore package to build their own loggers.\n\nAn FAQ
